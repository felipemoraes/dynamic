Family members of Kevin W. Harpham 37 described him in letters to the judge as a gentle intelligent well-liked young man whose actions puzzled them. "I know how and what he is " Harpham's mother Lana Harpham wrote to U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush. "I am very proud to say he is my son. I would want no other." The letters are part of a package presented to the court by Harpham's defense attorneys in advance of his Nov. 30 sentencing. He faces 27 to 32 years in federal prison. Prosecutors will file their sentencing recommendation soon Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Rice said. He had no comment on the defense request for 27 years. Harpham pleaded guilty in September to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to injure people in a hate crime. Two other charges will be dismissed. Harpham was arrested in March 9 after federal investigators tracked evidence including the purchase of lead fishing weights that were laced with rat poison and packed into the bomb as shrapnel. The bomb was discovered along the parade route Jan. 17 and disarmed without exploding. There were no injuries. Harpham's attorneys wrote that a sentence of 27 years was sufficient. "Mr. Harpham who has lived an exemplary life until recent events who has no criminal history who has been a good son brother neighbor soldier and friend deserves to have this Court take into account the good works that account for the majority of his life " defense attorneys wrote. "I have never seen Kevin be anything but gentle with both people and animals " wrote his sister Carmen Harpham. The letters describe family members attempting to understand how the man they knew would leave a bomb in downtown Spokane.

Mathews the founder of the neo-Nazi group The Order on Whidbey Island Wash. as his house burned down around him. Stanbary had a history of espousing white supremacist views according to the Southern Poverty Law Center which tracks hate groups. But investigators said Friday they did not believe the fire at his house had anything to do with the anniversary. Washougal detectives arranged with Stanbary's lawyer Tuesday that he would turn himself in on Thursday they said. Stanbary was arrested and served 90 days in jail following a standoff with sheriff's deputies in Bonner County Idaho in 1994. Authorities seized a weapons cache at his home including a grenade launcher a sawed-off shotgun and six AK-47 assault rifles. Homer Adams who worked for Stanbary at a landscaping company told the AP his boss mentioned Randy Weaver a white separatist involved in a deadly confrontation with federal agents in Idaho in 1992. Adams said the homeowner also seemed angry about the 1993 federal action in Waco Texas that led to the deaths of dozens of members of the Branch Davidian Church.

At the time of the man's arrest in Bonner County Idaho authorities confiscated more than two dozen weapons including six AK-47s and a grenade launcher according to an Associated Press story. Homer Adams worked for the owner of the Washougal home. He said the man who worked at a landscaping company was a fair boss. Adams said the man did mention Randy Weaver a white supremacist involved in a deadly confrontation with federal agents in Northern Idaho in 1992. Adams said the homeowner also seemed angry about the 1993 federal action in Waco Texas that led to the deaths of dozens of members of the Branch Davidian Church.

Their initial exploitation was through the fur trade as documented in the records of the Hudson's Bay Co. outposts in the unclaimed territories. Historical records cited in the report indicate the native gray wolf population was substantially reduced by traps poison and bullets in a five-decade period between 1850 and 1900. Besides their elimination on private grazing properties a concerted capture and kill effort primarily by the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey was undertaken on national forest lands open to grazing. State government bounties also were paid upon presentation of pelts at county offices in the early 1900s and records show that even the National Park Service contributed to the pogrom on wolves between 1910 and 1930 through their "predator control" efforts at Mount Rainier National Park. State researchers say that by the 1930s wolf numbers were so sparse in Washington the population was no longer considered viable.

Finger Jr. 32 sent phony statements to his clients that hid significant losses and commissions. He also charged huge commissions transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to his personal checking account to pay for his own credit card bills food and entertainment as well as business expenses such as payroll fees and taxes court records show. Finger now faces more than six years in federal prison under the plea deal with prosecutors. The amount of restitution will be determined at his sentencing on Feb. 17. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office said Finger owned and operated Black Diamond Capital Management LLC and Black Diamond Securities LLC of Kirkland. In the plea agreement Finger admits that some of the victims invested with him when he was working for a Seattle brokerage firm. In one case an investor placed nearly $700 000 with Finger for investments. From the fall of 2009 through 2010 Finger assured the client the investments were growing steadily when in fact the account was sustaining significant losses.

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen DEBATE over the safety of ''fracking'' in Australia has reignited after a gas project in Britain was named as the likely cause of 50 tremors this year. A panel of seismic experts has found it ''highly probable'' that fracking conducted by Cuadrilla Resources - 41 per cent-owned by Australian drilling company AJ Lucas - was the cause of two significant tremors and 48 aftershocks near the British town of Blackpool in April and May. The findings come after the independent MP Tony Windsor told the federal government this week he would not support its mining tax unless more was done to investigate the safety of fracking in Australia.
1320876720-1997c8cda4ad8a39b0a904baa1af9f7e,DD15-32,DD15-32.2,3,FORT WORTH -- Preliminary findings from a study of hydraulic fracturing and shale-gas development show no direct link between the controversial process and groundwater contamination the University of Texas professor who led the study said Wednesday. Problems in shale fields appear to be related to issues such as poor casing or cementing of wells rather than fracking UT geology professor Charles "Chip" Groat told about 150 people at the City Club in downtown Fort Worth. The audience included oil and gas industry representatives and city officials who regulate drilling in North Texas' Barnett Shale. The $300 000 study is being funded by UT's Energy Institute. Groat said a final report is expected to be issued in the next two months. The institute looked at reports of groundwater contamination in the Barnett Shale the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and East Texas and the Marcellus Shale in the Northeastern U.S. Groat said a major goal of the study is to "separate fact from fiction" and produce accurate information that will help government policymakers adopt wise policies and regulations that "are grounded in science." He said the institute also plans an in-depth "case study" of the Barnett Shale which would include water-related issues and other environmental concerns. "The Barnett is the poster child for shale-gas development " Groat said noting its pioneering role in combining advanced horizontal drilling and fracking techniques to extract large volumes of gas from shale formations. Groat said the institute would likely examine a controversy in which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an enforcement order against Fort Worth-based Range Resources claiming that two of its Barnett Shale gas wells caused or contributed to contamination of two residential water wells in Parker County. Range contends that its wells did not cause the contamination and is fighting the EPA in court. The EPA is conducting a nationwide study of hydraulic fracturing that is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 or later. As part of that effort the agency is conducting a case study in Denton and Wise counties to determine whether the process used in completion of Barnett gas wells has contaminated sources of drinking water. The fracking process pumps large volumes of water and sand along with a smaller volume of chemicals into the earth at high pressure to fracture dense rock formations allowing natural gas and oil to flow to the surface

The Greens spokesman on rural water and mining Jeremy Buckingham said the draft plan released this week appears to have met demands of the mining and gas extraction industries which rely heavily on water extraction. Mr Buckingham said the draft had made more than 600 gigalitres available which would meet the demands of future mining and gas extraction. The amount allowed for extraction in the Gunnedah Oxley Basin had been revised from zero to 300 gigalitres he said. Advertisement: Story continues below ''The area covered by the basin takes in more than 15 coal seam gas exploration licences spread from Muswellbrook west to Dubbo and north to the Queensland border. More than half of these licence areas are owned or part-controlled by Santos.'' Mr Buckingham said a letter from the NSW Office of Water to the chairman of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority Craig Knowles had suggested revisions in water allowances were linked to the needs of the mining industry. The letter from the NSW Office of Water's commissioner David Harriss obtained under freedom of information laws by the Friends of the Earth group says revised volumes of water ''are considered sufficient to meet likely demands for the mining industry for the period of the Basin Plan (2012 to 2022) while ensuring that extractions remain well within sustainable limits''. Mr Buckingham said the letter showed that the draft plan had increased the proposed take from 496 gigalitres to more than 650 gigalitres - a 32 per cent increase across six groundwater sources in northern NSW. The areas covered included the south coast to Wagga Wagga and south of Bourke where mineral exploration licences have been granted. Mr Buckingham said the Murray-Darling rescue plan had prioritised mining over food production and water for the environment. ''The community will take this as the government siding with the rights of miners.'' Mr Buckingham said that while the Murray-Darling Basin draft rescue plan had cut surface water extraction it had opened the way for more extraction of ground water. He said the authority had allocated new water without clear science supporting its assessment. The NSW Office of Water said the revised water allocations were unrelated to demands of the mining industry. ''Any claim that these allowances have been made in support of CSG exploration are completely false '' a spokesman said. Mr Knowles said while the authority sets the sustainable diversion limits for groundwater it doesn't determine how that water can be used. ''That's an issue for the relevant state government '' he said. ''Any new activity such as mining or coal seam gas mining is subject to state - and where relevant Commonwealth - planning approval. ''Under the Basin Plan's monitoring and evaluation program we'll monitor groundwater extractions and aquifer levels to ensure the sustainability of the basin's groundwater.''

1320218520-9e108568bd49c2a58120f56d48180784,DD15-34,DD15-34.1,3,I believe Dan Pike has showed great leadership in his four years as mayor of Bellingham. I have found him to be in touch with the people, and willing to stick his neck out to keep Bellingham safe. Pike has proven himself by being a straight talker, balancing the city budget during tough economic times, working to protect Lake Whatcom, and by taking a leadership role in fighting the coal port. His opponent, Kelli Linville, has said she opposes coal, but I believe has offered no plan as to what she would actually do about it. In fact, Linville has received campaign contributions in recent years from BNSF Railroad and SSA Marine, two of the main companies that stand to reap huge profits off of the coal port if we allow it to go in. This is in addition to contributions from the NRA, BP, Chevron, Pfizer, and dozens of other corporations and special interest groups that are at odds with my personal values. This should give us a clue as to how she would perform her duties as mayor, and what her priorities really are. I hope you will join me in voting for Dan Pike. Andrea Wallace

They said that while Kelli Linville says she's against the coal terminal, Dan Pike had demonstrated his opposition by taking decisive action against the port. I agree. When Mayor Pike announced his opposition to the Gateway terminal, Linville criticized him for saying "no" before regulators had concluded the permitting process. It's now perfectly clear to me that this is a coal port, that Bellingham might lose its waterfront and become a coal town, and Linville states she knew it was a coal port last October and has always been against it. But she hasn't done anything to actively oppose the project, and defers instead to a permitting process that could likely grant its approval.

1320572340-b37a822b733eaac49b4dc00b2cec2995,DD15-34,DD15-34.1,2,I received Kelli Linville's flyer in the mail. It reads, "I do not support exporting coal or any other non-renewable resource. If the proposed SSA Marine terminal is proven to be a sole-purpose coal pier then I oppose it." I felt this was double-speak, with the intent to confuse the voters who would just read the first statement. According to the Gateway Pacific's own literature, the terminal will be used 88 percent of the time for coal export and 12 percent for other goods. The key words in Kelli's flyer are "sole-purpose coal pier" and since 88 percent isn't 100 percent, I believe Kelli Linville will support the construction of the Gateway Pacific Terminal and exporting coal through this terminal to China. Other candidates have come out for or against the shipping of coal to China. I admire that they take a stand and let the voters decide on the merits of position. Kelli Linville has received donations from SSA Marine in past campaigns. In doing so, don't voters have the right to know that she might feel obligated to support Gateway Pacific's position, hence the double-speak in her flyer?

As Wechsler sees it the State Environmental Policy Act sets stringent standards for environmental review that could block SSA Marine's plans if studies show the coal terminal could not be built without harm to the environment.

1320537420-a488a96b2be55c7f87ea947bd17ba9d4,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,3,Last week, the story of the coal terminal proposed by SSA Marine received widespread attention with coverage from both National Geographic and NPR. This national coverage shows that the world is watching what is playing out here in Bellingham. As the first elected official to publicly voice opposition to the Gateway Pacific Terminal, I believe Mayor Pike has since been an outspoken advocate for Bellingham's best interests. The media's spotlight has been drawn here because there is the makings of a great story. There is a sense that Bellingham may prevail against the corporate Goliaths in this instance. Thanks to what I see as Pike's bold leadership, Bellingham and the other impacted cities along the rail corridor may be writing a happy ending to an otherwise tragic tale. Rather than getting mired in the weeds of which candidate said what, on which date, let us evaluate the candidates through the prism of their actions. Pike's actions on this issue are loud and clear. Who we vote for as mayor matters. Vote Pike. Kimberley Lund

That is not true. Kelli has been clear in the press, on her website, and in all debates: She does not now nor has she ever supported a dedicated coal terminal at Cherry Point. In fact, she opposed the last coal pier project proposed for Cherry Point 25 years ago.

In it, I believe he lies about Kelli Linville's position on the proposed coal terminal at Cherry Point. As recently as February 2011, Pike himself was unclear about the coal terminal, stating "The jobs are nothing to scoff at" in the article entitled "Bellingham mayor: Region needs jobs from shipping terminal at Cherry Point." Linville's position has always been clear. She does not support a single-commodity coal terminal at Cherry Point. Her direct quote, taken from her website, is "I have been consistent from day one. I do not support exporting coal or any other non-renewable natural resources. I do not now, nor have I ever, supported a coal terminal at Cherry Point." I call on Pike and his supporters to accurately state his opponent's position on a coal terminal. Bellingham deserves better.

1322723880-b2871f15cc09bc2bfe56cdf813d97681,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,2,Do you think the fact that Rob Murray, the husband of Sen. Patty Murray, works for SSA Marine will have any effect on SSA Marine obtaining approval to build and operate a major shipping terminal at Cherry Point?
1320325560-da7ecec6b8f8d00e83283dc2d3797eab,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,2,. Mayor Pike has taken a leadership role in the state in opposing the exporting of coal at the Gateway Pacific Terminal. Ultimately, the County Council approves or denies permits, without which SSA may not transform the previously permitted bulk commodities terminal into the largest coal export facility in North America. Christina Maginnis is a water quality expert, and I believe Alan Black's commitment to land stewardship brings a much needed balance to our County Council as it balances environmental and economic impacts of current and proposed actions.

As recently as June 3, The Bellingham Herald reported that Linville believed "it's too soon to oppose or support the project." With Bellingham neighborhoods awash in a sea of anti-coal signs, suddenly she claims to have always opposed the project? Directly contradicting her own words? Just as national media are doing stories on Pike's leadership? Just as ballots are being cast? I believe Bellingham is engaged in a heroic struggle, standing up to big money and to big coal. I think the efforts of Linville supporters to explain their candidate's position are understandable, but nothing can change the facts.

1320325560-485db0a830412822e244459d7c109916,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,1,We support Dan Pike's re-election as Bellingham mayor. He has been a statewide leader in insisting that all aspects of the plan to export coal from Cherry Point be examined. Pike understands that this proposal will drastically change the face of our community and make it difficult to develop the proposed waterfront project that the city has been planning for years. Pike is committed to protecting our interests and deserves another term to continue economic development for Bellingham. Bob and Sue Hynes
1320572280-76fbc3e2fb26c6ce5055288d0e6ac1d8,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,2,. What burden of radioactive compounds does this coal carry? I would think that an accurate monitoring system must be in place to check every coal car for radioactivity before it leaves the Powder River Basin. Rain falls on this coal as it travels. Does this water, filtered through the coal, pick up toxics of any kind to contaminate our soil and groundwater? Also, will rainwater percolate through coal stored at the terminal then contaminate the Cherry Point waters? Should we ship this coal for China to burn so that toxic emissions, radioactive compounds among them, will be carried back across the Pacific to us by the jetstream?

I believe the proposed terminal at Cherry Point will create neither long term jobs nor revenue. The small number of jobs will go to union people with seniority from other areas. The revenues? The federal government will pay for substantial parts of the port development and hugely expanded railroad infrastructure, leaving the taxpayers on the hook for the bill. And when they leave, we will still be paying that bill. I believe that's a fact. And the profits? They will go to Peabody Coal, Goldman Sachs and their investors.

1320218520-5997865295f466278a62281cf4422e99,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,2,I believe the proposed coal port at Cherry Point would let big money rule. The port would cater to the bloated profit margins of Goldman Sachs, Peabody Energy and SSA Marine while ruining our chance for waterfront development. I believe these big-money players would gladly spoil our air, land and sea while grabbing the profits and tossing to us only a portion of the jobs that development will offer us. Dan not only speaks out against this plan, ignoring the political price others routinely cow tow to, he took a statewide leadership role against the coal port.
1320572280-b2725e25ef2514278159629bd173b602,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,2,The Gateway Pacific Terminal project at Cherry Point is predicted to create approximately 1,200 jobs. I feel that this data is biased due to the fact that it came from economists hired by SSA Marine, the shipping company that proposed the terminal, and especially because no negative externalities were included in their calculations. I believe increased traffic would contribute to environmental pollution, real estate values would be reduced, there may be public expenses at rail crossings, and business opportunities may be restricted due to imposing a less attractive appeal. The environment needs to be a more serious consideration of corporations and the local community if we are to preserve our natural, limited resources which are constantly being abused. In addition, I believe the majority of these jobs are only temporary. Pouring time and money into a project to promote short-term economic growth through the means of consumption is a futile effort. The lasting results will be environmental destruction and pollution for the sake of profit. The negative externalities not included in economic calculations are bound to have the greatest long-term effects. Factors of consumption and degradation of the environment must be included if we are to make accurate predictions about our fragile future. Erika Bro

When I spoke to Kelli Linville on Oct. 19, she stated she supports a multi-use terminal - including coal. I was shocked, disappointed. I voted for Linville in the past.

In a letter to SSA Marine Vice President Skip Sahlin, Schroeder notes that the Whatcom County Code imposes a 90-day deadline for submission of the permit applications for the Gateway Pacific Terminal project once an applicant files a preliminary notice with the county. But the code also specifies that the deadline "shall be extended at the applicant's request in 90-day increments." This is the second 90-day extension for SSA Marine.

1323753900-fb5cd3cdb1c45b89000144b7e2426ee9,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,2,SSA Marine must be nervous about its proposed Gateway Pacific Terminal. The company recently distributed brochures bragging about the benefits of the coal-handling facility. But how valid are the company's claims? What about the economic, environmental and health costs to haul millions of tons of coal through Washington, store it at Cherry Point, load it onto enormous ships, and greatly increase traffic throughout the Salish Sea? The company claims that facility operation would generate $11 million a year in taxes. What about the costs to local governments associated with the terminal, increased train and ship traffic, and people who work at the facility? Will the costs to schools, parks, libraries, roads, water- and sewer-treatment plants, etc. exceed the tax revenue? SSA Marine is silent on this issue. The company claims that operating the terminal will create 1,251 jobs. How many of these jobs will go to people already living in Whatcom County versus those who move from other areas? Again, the brochures say nothing on this issue. It is reasonable for a project proponent to tout the benefits of that project. However, I believe it is dishonest to ignore offsetting costs plus environmental and public-health problems.

1323789300-3c9e345c123eed6015e568b40299e998,DD15-34,DD15-34.2,1,I recently had a debate in my communications class at WWU about the Cherry Point coal terminal and came across John Stark's Aug. 4 article about the incident involving SSA Marine destroying wetlands to help with transportation. What really grinds my gears is this idea that big companies like this expect to disturb natural, long-standing habitats as well as dissolve the environmental reputation that Bellingham has worked so hard for just to get a quick buck. I believe what SSA Marine plans to do is unacceptable and rather distasteful, especially when they know they can walk away with a slap on the wrist and an insincere apology. I hope that the good people of Bellingham can see through the corporate manipulation to maintain the serenity and overall well-being of their home.

I have walked at Cherry Point for more than 40 years at different times of the year. I have seen heavy rains and substantial drainage cause some of these cliffs to crumble onto the beach. The soaked earth there does not seem to be stable. What if an earthquake would happen at a particularly wet time and cause the cliffs and the coal to go plunging to the beach and into the sea

Moreover, much of the hydroelectric generation in Washington is owned by the federal government and operated on behalf of customers in multiple states. A better proxy for "Washington's electricity" might be the mix of generation in the U.S. portion of the Northwest power pool. This incorporates coal plants in Oregon, Montana, Wyoming and Utah owned by utilities that serve Washington customers. The fuel burners, unlike the hydro generators, are a for-profit industry. Instead of telling the coal generation plants to back off on generation, the federal government is telling the wind producers to let the wind turbines flap in the breeze when water levels are high. I believe this strategy is an effort to stymie growth in the renewable fuels movement.

1323753900-4d3cd25a671fb92694eb65cc3b0ba644,DD15-34,DD15-34.3,2,I'm very concerned about the impending coal port and the local and global implications if it gets built. I attended a meeting Nov. 30 with community organizers who are trying to put a stop to what I believe will be a disaster. There were many wonderful ideas presented to try and fight these people off. But I think we should replace SSA's idea with a better one. Why doesn't Bellingham work on attracting the wind energy industry (or solar, etc) to "green energy friendly Bellingham"? It would be a perfect fit, and an industry of any size would provide our residents with real jobs, not the nonexistent and temporary jobs that I believe SSA has in store for us. Without trashing our community and the bay. And the Earth. And letting us give back in an important way. These industries already employ more folks than the coal industry and a green economy will continue to benefit the region far into the future.
1325429160-c696fc8fce92cc1866547f55047fd270,DD15-34,DD15-34.4,2,A recent pamphlet regarding SSA Marine's Cherry Point facility stated that there would only be nine coal trains going through Bellingham per day. I'm sure they meant nine full trains and nine empty trains. This, coupled with the four daily existing full coal trains and four empty coal trains, makes a total of 26 trains per day. This, combined with the other existing freight and Amtrak trains, should make for very congested track crossings. Each existing coal train contains 128 to 132 cars. That's quite a long train. Now, multiply this times 24 and you've congested every rail crossing from Bellingham to Grandview Road on a 24-hour basis. I believe the negative impact on the new port development and waterfront businesses located west of the tracks will take a big hit. Fire and emergency response times will also be greatly hampered. Access to the Silver Reef Casino will be impacted. The only way to stop this is through the Congress. Sen. Patty Murray's husband works for SSA Marine, so I believe that avenue's out. And don't forget those insensitive train horns at 4 in the morning. Something to think about. I'm for jobs, but not at this expense.

1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.3,4,. "This one was grandfathered in," said retired Marine Corps. Col. John Mack, who heads the Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officer Training unit at Snohomish High School and is in charge of the squad that fires the cannon. "We're the only school allowed to do it."

Hospital staff had to move him to a secure room where they monitored visitors.
1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.4,4,Callers and visitors told Karch they would "make sure his other leg got blown off," and that "there would be retaliation" if the family cooperated in an investigation that could end the cannon tradition

Karch has since undergone three surgeries to implant a titanium rod the length of his shin to replace the decimated bone and to graft skin over the shredded tissue. In February, doctors plan to graft bone from his hip into his leg to help it heal. "
1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.5,4,My leg was in so many pieces, it was like a jigsaw puzzle," said Karch. "

And despite invitations to school friends, not a single person other than family attended his 16th birthday celebration in November, Bissell said
1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.6,4,Bissel suspects some of the reaction may be because she retained a lawyer to help her understand legal forms the school district asked her to sign after the accident.
1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.6,4,According to Langer, the school district has been cooperative and has said it plans to establish a fund to pay for Karch's medical expenses.
1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.6,2,What Bissel wants for her son, though, is the emotional support of the community they've lived in for a decade.

1322155980-ddd074e2d263473cbe536cd1e6243f86,DD15-37,DD15-37.6,4,You have a kid here who's lost part of his leg, who may always have a rod in it," she said. "Where's the compassion? How would these guys feel if it were their son? Would the cannon really matter?"

Antonella Enea testified she taught Sahar for two years before the teen's death. Enea said Sahar confided in her and the teacher told the court she twice called youth protection services. Enea said the last call was made in June 2009 after Sahar said she was afraid because her father was returning from overseas and one of her siblings was going to tell him she was "a whore." The teacher testified she called youth protection officials and they advised her to locate a shelter in the community where Sahar could go if she needed to leave her home. Youth protection services told Enea there was no social worker assigned to Sahar's case even though a complaint was made a year before. On Wednesday two school vice-principals told the jury they were concerned about the Shafia girls after a series of unexplained absences and behaviour that was growing increasingly out of character for them.

That's where the story becomes disputed... The video is dramatic; gunfire rings out as self-appointed Seattle superhero Phoenix Jones and his crew chase after the shooter amidst a bustling Belltown on New Year's Eve. While a fellow super is claiming credit for the guy's ultimate arrest, crime fighting controversy is brewing as Phoenix disputes the claims in an interview with 97.3 KIRO FM's John Curley . He was on patrol with his crew of eight, including a guest superhero from Oakland who goes by the name Motormouth, when suddenly they heard a spray of gunfire. On the video, you can see and hear the excited reaction as they run toward the scene, armed with two new $10,000 bat-shaped bulletproof shields. "Wait a second, where did you get $10,000?!" asked an incredulous Curley. Turns out, the shields were donated and they came in handy. "We sort of formed a wall and everybody got behind," said Phoenix. Curley wonders how the other six people without a shield felt about running toward gunfire, but that's another story for another day. The real story is the controversy that ensued. Motormouth claimed in an interview with SF Weekly he was able to count the number of shots fired, determined the gunman was out of bullets and then rushed him, forcing him to surrender. But Phoenix said it was a very different story. "Motor never ran up to the guy," Phoenix said. "It's not because we're superheroes, it's because because eight guys were running toward him." Phoenix credits Seattle Police for responding within 45 seconds. As for Motor's claims he counted bullets? "I am going to say that I've made that mistake before," recounted Phoenix of a time he went after an armed man and thought he'd already fired six shots. "So after the sixth one, I stood up to run toward him and he goes "Bam!"...'that's number seven,' "Bam!" 'that's number eight.' And by the time he got to me I thought I was going to die. That's when I found out certain revolvers have eight," laughed Jones.

Zehm who had committed no crime was beaten shot with a Taser hog-tied and sat on until he passed out and died two days later without regaining consciousness. According to court records Zehm's final words were "All I wanted was a Snicker's bar." After what federal prosecutors described as five years of cover ups by local officials a federal jury in November convicted Officer Karl Thompson for use of excessive force and lying about it to investigators. It was at a post-conviction hearing where Thompson's freedom was revoked that the 50 officers stood at attention and saluted him. "I was shocked by their willingness to ignore the fact that 12 jurors ... found what Officer Thompson did was a criminal act " said attorney Jeffrey Finer who also represents the Zehm family in their lawsuit against the city.

The federally appointed Cohen Commission was called two years ago to examine what caused the 2009 collapse of the Fraser River sockeye. The suggestion that an influenza-like virus had penetrated B.C. waters came just as the 21-month inquiry was wrapping up prompting the commissioner to hold three more days of hearings. On Friday the federal inquiry heard from an expert in infectious salmon anemia (ISA) who detected the virus in a handful of B.C. fish earlier this year setting off a chain of alarm bells throughout the government and the West Coast salmon industry. Fred Kibenge who runs a prestigious lab on the East Coast detected the virus in two of 48 sockeye smolts and the results of his work were widely publicized in October. The ISA virus has infected and killed millions of fish in Chile and is believed to have originated in Norway where its own stocks were devastated. 'Turning the PR tide'

Now, 132 passengers on a Frontier Airlines flight are being contacted after another nurse, Amber Vinson, was diagnosed on Wednesday. Ebola, which is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of a symptomatic patient, has a transmissible period of 21 days. Under CDC guidelines, everyone who comes in direct contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient are watched for signs of illness during that period. If a contact develops a fever or other Ebola symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting, they are isolated, provided care and contact tracing begins for them. From an epidemiology point of view, Ebola differs from other infectious diseases because the morbidity and mortality rates are higher, so a larger number of contacts are traced.

The Community health workers should be chosen based on their areas of residence. The reasons for this are simple: firstly, the community worker is known and trusted as already established. Secondly, typical average African communities have the tendency of practising medical pluralism. What I mean here is that it is possible to have a family who will hang on to their ill relative and try to manage the situation before seeking professional medical attention. Again, there are traditional rites that are performed with corpses. The role of the CHW therefore is to be able to trace such situations and report to hierarchy early enough for the right thing to be done. To do this, the CHW must master the territory which is assigned to him, thus justifying the argument that they should be chosen from the areas where they reside.

Trade-offs must be made because the first 2 characteristics are absolute requirements and affect the other 4. Some currently available products provide excellent protection but are nearly impossible to remove without self-contamination. For example, some of these products are hoods that cover the head and neck and were designed to protect the patient from the hair or skin squames of the health care worker during surgical procedures. When a worker removes the hood over the head, the external surface of the hood frequently touches the skin of the face. Thus, there is a need to redesign these products to provide protection of the same body areas but make removing them easier via having the products open and fall away from the worker to avoid touching skin. Another potential option may be the use of disposable blunt scissors to cut the PPE in strategic locations to facilitate removal. However, this would require controlled experiments to ensure safety.

However, given that virus is found both in bodily fluids and on the surface of the skin, it should be assumed that gowns and gloves become highly contaminated during direct patient care, particularly when the patient is vomiting and has diarrhea. Recent training of health care workers on use of PPE has revealed that removal without touching skin or underclothing with the external surface of the gloves or gown is difficult and that extensive practice is required to achieve proficiency with currently available PPE technology. The important point is that wearing and removing PPE require a high level of precision. There is no information about the risk for infection after skin contamination, but until further research provides additional data, contamination of even intact skin must be completely avoided. Even if skin breaks are necessary for infection, transfer of virus from intact skin to mucous membranes is likely to occur given the frequency with which many persons typically touch their nose, mouth, and eyes.

However, there is evidence that routine use of gowns, gloves, and masks is associated with frequent self-contamination. A study at the University of Maryland showed that when caring for intensive care unit patients infected or colonized with an MDRO, health care workers self-contaminated their hands with the same MDRO after wearing gloves and gowns during 5% of care episodes.2 It has also been shown that contamination increases with environmental burden,3 which is particularly important later in the course of Ebola disease given the high viral load, gastrointestinal manifestations, and, in some cases, bleeding. Despite the high rate of self-contamination, health care workers are rarely infected with one of these MDROs but can serve as vectors spreading the MDRO to other critically ill patients if their hand hygiene adherence is not 100%. These silent transmission events have been tacitly allowed to occur because of the inability to link a specific episode of nonadherence with hand hygiene to transmission, and there has been limited funding for MDR-bacterial research, which might target PPE or other infection prevention system improvements.4

In addition, the donning and removal processes are to be coached and supervised by a trained observer to minimize breaches in protocol. While the changes should diminish the risk of transmission to the health care worker, removal of the PPE is now even more complicated. Thus, the need for improved protective technologies continues to evolve.

The use of cumbersome PPE in the extreme heat and difficult working conditions of Ebola treatment centers in Africa places great stress on health care workers and limits the time they can spend providing patient care. A novel approach to PPE that provides an impermeable fluid barrier that is both more comfortable and easier to don and remove would be a substantial step forward. This will require new materials and designs. Indeed, the US Agency for International Development, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, CDC, and US Department of Defense have recently announced a campaign to develop and test innovations for PPE in response to the Ebola outbreak.9 Importantly, improvements in PPE will also assist with better control of MDROs, which is especially needed given the lack of therapeutic options for highly resistant gram-negative bacillary infections. Better PPE will improve safety for both health care workers and patients.

Recently, reports of nosocomial transmission of Ebola virus to 2 nurses from the same patient in Texas (despite their use of PPE) has generated great concern and presents new challenges, particularly because there is no postexposure prophylaxis or effective antiviral therapy for Ebola, and approximately half of the cases are fatal.

Trade-offs must be made because the first 2 characteristics are absolute requirements and affect the other 4. Some currently available products provide excellent protection but are nearly impossible to remove without self-contamination. For example, some of these products are hoods that cover the head and neck and were designed to protect the patient from the hair or skin squames of the health care worker during surgical procedures. When a worker removes the hood over the head, the external surface of the hood frequently touches the skin of the face. Thus, there is a need to redesign these products to provide protection of the same body areas but make removing them easier via having the products open and fall away from the worker to avoid touching skin. Another potential option may be the use of disposable blunt scissors to cut the PPE in strategic locations to facilitate removal. However, this would require controlled experiments to ensure safety.

Favipivavir is approved in Japan for treating influenza. Brincidofovir is unapproved but a lot of safety data have been gathered. The WHO's Scientific and Advisory Committee on Ebola Experimental Interventions though found in November that preclinical data regarding these drugs' effectiveness against Ebola was less than promising.

Should Dr. Khan become the first human to receive an untested drug with unproven efficacy and unknown risk? It was a question they could ask because of a simple quirk of fate. A single dose of the treatment happened to be within reach of that remote field hospital in rural Sierra Leone. It was a lone sample of the drug called ZMapp one of apparently only five in the world brought by the Canadian scientists who helped develop it. The Canadian team was testing the drug at a field laboratory near the border with Guinea simply to see how it would hold up in the African heat according to a statement released by Doctors Without Borders. When they offered it to the physicians treating Dr. Khan they triggered an unprecedented philosophical debate that was argued across continents as the virus wreaked its havoc on their colleague and friend. The drug had never been tested on humans. What if it caused an allergic reaction that killed Dr. Khan?

For instance should a safe and effective vaccine become available the vaccination coverage needed for elimination will depend on pre-existing immunity in the population (appendix). Immunity resulting from asymptomatic infections should reduce the intervention effort needed to interrupt transmission but might also complicate the design and interpretation of vaccine trials.

Thus for assessment of vaccines and other countermeasures baseline serum should be collected to improve both estimates of intervention effectiveness and our understanding of asymptomatic immunity. Additionally assessment of intervention measures should account for the contribution of asymptomatic immunity in curbing epidemic spread.

Particularly results from one post-Ebola outbreak serosurvey showed that 71% of seropositive individuals did not have the disease; another study reported that 46% of asymptomatic close contacts of patients with Ebola were seropositive. Although asymptomatic infections are unlikely to be infectious they might confer protective immunity and thus have important epidemiological consequences.

We illustrate this point by comparing the projections of two simple models based on the Ebola epidemic in Liberia a model that does not account for asymptomatic infections and another that assumes 50% of infections are asymptomatic and induce protective immunity.

Four people were said to have been injured in the clashes with security forces in the West Point area of Monrovia where blockades have been put in place in an attempt to curb the spread of the disease. "The soldiers are using live rounds " said army spokesman Dessaline Allison adding: "The soldiers applied the rules of engagement. They did not fire on peaceful citizens. There will be medical reports if (an injury) was from bullet wounds." It is unknown whether anyone was injured by the gunfire but a Reuters photographer claims to have seen a young boy with his leg "largely severed just above the ankle".

Don't scream "Sign Up Now" in your emails. Be precise and to the point and tell what they would be signing up for instead of the email just being 100% hype. 2. How are you presenting the offer? Part of the sales process are visuals and within it'self is accountable for a good amount of the sales made by any affiliate or service provider. Design an eye catching email that will "Instantly" grab their attention where they have to keep reading or they feel the need to click on the link contained within to find out more. MadMimi has a great software for building custom emails and also offers affordable rates for mass email sending. 3. Who are you sending them to? Who's your audience and who is receiving these emails? Perhaps the only reason your earnings are low if you've done the two previous steps that I stated above. Are you sending to opt-ins? Did you buy the emails or did you harvest them yourself? If you were to have the email addresses to 10,000 people who were interested in your offer, you'd earn a lot more than $4 so try to optimize your email list for better conversions. I hope this helps and if you need any additional help or information, just send me a Private Message. Good luck!

Now start pumping that link out there for the sign up, and before you know a targeted list will start to form in front of your eyes. Now that is something that sounds like email marketing with a plan. Having a good plan is the only way you will be succesful. If you could get rich by randomly spamming 10 000 people with a 1 line offer that smells dodgy from miles away, the world would have a lot more millionaires. Try and make a business plan where you bring at least a little value to the receiver (or at least get him to perceive that what you are offering is of value)

If an SMTP has been abused, that SMTP would become blacklisted by the likes of hotmail, gmail etc. Any mail sent from a blacklisted SMTP is unlikely to get through spam filters. You can send emails from your computer without the use of an SMTP, you can use port 25. I suggest you read this first as most email clients block port 25 for this reason. Cant put links yet, but add this to the end of wiki's domain without quotes, "/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques" You may find sendblaster 2. sendblaster.com/ They have a recommended SMTP that you can use.

People that don't use the internet that often get annoyed - but it won't go nowhere. People who do use the internet often don't remember shit from shinolah as far as what they clicked and what they agreed too, so they are likely to ignore/delete the unwanted messages. I for one get hundreds of spam email/day on one of my email accounts. I scan them over long enough to make sure I didn't miss anything important, then delete them. Its like getting direct marketing mats in your mailbox. You didn't ask for it, but somewhere along (a very long line) you agreed to receive stuff. Are you going to contact you local post office, legislator or city official to complain? Probably not. Even if you DID, they'll probably smile and nod. Bottom line, scraping isn't as big an issue as what and how you use what you get.

Ross Ulbricht, a San Francisco 30-year-old web developer was arrested by FBI in a sting operation in October 2013 accusing him of being the criminal mastermind running Silk Road, where hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal goods were traded. Ross Ulbricht had claimed that he had built Silk Road, but he was not the site's notorious ringleader "Dread Pirate Roberts." The trial went on for just over three weeks and today the jury of six men and six women charged Ross Ulbricht with seven counts including money laundering, drug trafficking and computer hacking among other things.

This is really all about establishing a beachhead with a breakthrough technology. People who deal in bitcoin are expecting the technology to grow. Also, keep in mind that the value of bitcoin will rise against the dollar, so the bitcoins you earn today will probably be worth 4x that in the future.

This means you can never be hacked or digitally wiped out somehow. Bitcoin can be both an online currency and an offline currency. Don't trust your bitcoin on an online wallet service? Just print them out and lock them away in your safe.

Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.

Its like torrents - impossible to shut down. The only thing the US could do to stop bitcoin is to say that using bitcoin is illegal and buying/selling/trading in bitcoin is illegal.

Just a friendly nudge to all of those new to the flipping business

Do some calculations: 5-10 articles, theme, traffic - even if it takes you as little as 10 hours (which I doubt, especially together with listing) then $100 minus the auction fees will net you an hourly rate of $8.

How much is my site worth?** This is by far the most common question (probably 1 thread in 3 is a valuation request), so here are some pointers: a) If your site isn't making any money then it's probably worth less than $50. b) Try to have a quick look around Flippa and other marketplaces and see what sites similar to yours are selling for. Don't expect others to do the research for you. c) There is a sticky thread specifically for valuation requests so there's no point in opening a new thread with yours. In fact, both meathead1234 and I typically don't respond in separate valuation threads but do keep an eye on the sticky thread so if you want our opinion, your best bet is to post there.

What they care about is the fact that the site is generating revenue and has solid history. That said, 3 months of history is not a whole lot - and this will scare away quite a few buyers which in turn will affect the price you will get for the site. With this in mind, if all all possible I would suggest you to hold on to your sites for at least 6 months, and if everything look OK then (revenue is stable or increasing, everything's alright with traffic) then you can easily get a 12+ multiple.

It teaches people to create websites and list them on Flippa with no traffic or revenue, but fails to take into account that the days when turnkey sites sold for $200+ are long gone and today the sellers of this kind of sites are lucky to gross an average of $75-$100 a pop (if that!), out of which you'll have to pay over a half to Flippa, then some for the domain name, and then the hours it will take you to build the site and manage the listing.

So saying that no decent properties get listed on Flippa is definitely inaccurate. The key to buying through Flippa is getting to the point where you can quickly filter through all of the rubbish (common scam attempts, faked or inflated traffic/revenue, over-SEO'ed sites, sites established yesterday, etc.) and only spend time looking through listings that are possibly decent. There are no quick tips that can be given on this though - it all comes with experience. With that said, based on "and making it profitable in < 2 years" I'm assuming that you're looking at "turn-key" sites that aren't already generating profit? If so, stop right there. 99% of those sites aren't worth anything and the majority of them will never generate more than $2 a month. If they would, then the serial sellers would operate their profitable sites, rather than flocking out new ones and offloading them on Flippa for $100 a pop. Only look for sites that are ALREADY profitable and come with history.

Good websites you keep unless you seriously don't want to mess with them any longer and even then it is probably better business sense to run them until they kill themselves. Very rarely does it make sense to sell good websites and if you look at what buyers are expecting to pay for such websites it probably makes even less sense bringing them to market.

That's what I've seen similar sites go for in there. If you do the auction properly and the site is decent 10-12 months is about the max you can expect to get for a new site so don't be too greedy.

If you follow the Escrow firm's (be it Escrow.com or someone else - only use reputable escrow firms though!) advice, never transfer anything before the funds are secured, etc. then you can consider yourself 99% safe. b) Spot the obvious red flags. When dealing with people on Flippa there is quite a bit of research you can do. Do they have negative feedback? Do they have connected accounts? Is there anything else that seems off on their account overview page? Do you get any dodgy results when you google their name and their flippa username? These are all obvious red flags but many people tend to ignore them for the sake of getting a "too good to be true" deal. In 99% of cases though, these deals ARE too good to be true and you should move on, rather than risk your hard-earned cash. c) Always try and have an actual conversation with the buyer/seller of the site. If you don't want to get on the phone with them then at least get them on Skype. Speaking to a person can reveal quite a bit about them and in my 4+ years in this business I've noticed that most scammers are extremely afraid of getting on the phone. In my case, the rule is quite simple - if you're not willing to get on the phone with me then I'm not buying from you. End of story. And having completed over 200 transaction I haven't been scammed once so I must be doing something right ![](https://static.blackhatworld.com /blackhat-seo/images/smilies/smile.png)

So saying that no decent properties get listed on Flippa is definitely inaccurate. The key to buying through Flippa is getting to the point where you can quickly filter through all of the rubbish (common scam attempts, faked or inflated traffic/revenue, over-SEO'ed sites, sites established yesterday, etc.) and only spend time looking through listings that are possibly decent. There are no quick tips that can be given on this though - it all comes with experience. With that said, based on "and making it profitable in < 2 years" I'm assuming that you're looking at "turn-key" sites that aren't already generating profit? If so, stop right there. 99% of those sites aren't worth anything and the majority of them will never generate more than $2 a month. If they would, then the serial sellers would operate their profitable sites, rather than flocking out new ones and offloading them on Flippa for $100 a pop. Only look for sites that are ALREADY profitable and come with history.

They knowingly allow the sale of fraudulent sites. There are numerous posts out there and some in great detail explaining how flippa turns a blind eye to these scams and especially shill bidding. I've personally had multiple experiences of trying to report obvious scam auctions to flippa only to have my comments removed and warned by flippa to stop posting even though all my comments were factual and sale related.

I was browsing through the listings and saw some interesting deals but I'm not stupid either.. The chance of getting scammed is pretty high so I wanna know what to expect in the worst case scenario. Let's say I buy a website for 2k which claims to make 200 a day with adsense or whatever monetizing. After the purchase the traffic turns out to be fake and I have 0 adsense revenue. Can I ask the money back or something similar? I know that if you buy with paypal you can open a dispute but most of them are using escrow.

With this kind of expectations you're bound to land ONLY at scam listings as nobody in their right mind would agree to a deal even remotely similar to this.

Basically it's your responsibility as a seller to make 100% sure that the site is legit that you know how to operate it and that you're fully comfortable with it before bidding let alone signing the purchase agreement.

Then I would look hard into which type of web site it is that you are wanting to own due your due diligence on the web site and seller of who you are looking to purchase from positive feedback is a plus and best of luck to finding your purchase!

Most of the shit on there are 2 months old sites that claim to have 5-20k traffic and make 500 to 3k per month unverified analytics or adsense completely fabricated affiliate sales and spammy broken english. It's literally harder to steal candy from a baby than to sell to some of the retards on there. I'm even thinking of starting my own brokerage like empire flippers but still auction-based.

It's pretty much impossible to believe that anyone would pay $80k for a site that seems dodgy and just as hard to believe that someone making that per month from the site would go through the process and the inevitable escrow wait and possible claimbacks all for the purpose of definitively selling it for that one-time flat fee. Good for Thimas though he deserves that windfall.

I don'tthink site flipping will become saturated because quite frankly, it's too much work and risk for most people. Not only does it take a little money to get started, but you also have to have at least some experience in coding, designing and traffic/revenue generation.

Just a friendly nudge to all of those new to the flipping business

In order to sell/flip something you must first have something of value. To get this, you have two options: a) **Build it.** You will find tons of advice on building profitable websites (which is what you need if you want to sell them) in other parts of this forum. b) **Buy it.** Advice on this you can find from the Site Flipping section. There are already a lot of threads about where to find bargains but the most common answer is that you should first familiarise yourself with how the market works and what to look for, and then you'll be able to spot these bargains at almost any marketplace.
com_blackhatworld_www_30852c6e39a22f1b81793dafd9f261e80483c9f9_1427050664084,DD15-92,DD15-92.4,3,Many people who are new in this game want to build their website and then sellit as quickly as possible. My advice is the exact opposite. Even if your site has taken of very nicely, you will NEVER get a decent multiple for a site that has only a few months of history behind it. As a rule of thumb, you should have **at least** 4-5 months of stable revenue history before you go ahead and sell the site, but personally I suggest you to hold on to the site until you have closer to a year of history before you consider selling. I realise that the option to cash out quickly is appealing to many, but at the end of the day you will be the loser in this deal as when selling a 2 months old site you're likely to only get 4-5 months worth of earnings for it, whereas a year-old site can easily go for 12x or more.

The (sad) truth is that Flippa has absolute monopoly in the low-end market and it will stay like this until another serious player emerges.

I've tried on various forums, and all of them turn up at a dead end. I post my monthly earnings and end up getting offers for half of that from random noobs.

com_blackhatworld_www_142e85eb837f0f110a47b72f2126e0059eb27869_1427052939034,DD15-92,DD15-92.4,3,While there are some "un-desirable" niches, the majority of buyers on Flippadon't care a whole lot whether the site in question is a micro niche site, a forum or a cookie recipe collection for that matter. What they care about is the fact that the site is generating revenue and has solid history. That said, 3 months of history is not a whole lot - and this will scare away quite a few buyers which in turn will affect the price you will get for the site. With this in mind, if all all possible I would suggest you to hold on to your sites for at least 6 months, and if everything look OK then (revenue is stable or increasing, everything's alright with traffic) then you can easily get a 12+ multiple.

Not a very good business plan to say the least.

I was clearing out my remaining sites and somebody wants to buy them in bulk around 10. I made a video tutorial for buyers to transfer thier own sites but lately I have ran into major tech issues with that method and ended up paying somebody to fix it. My tech guy has just quoted me over $100 to move the sites but that will savage my profits. Is there an ebook or video that I can buy that details the process so I can just give this to the buyer or maybe there is a flipper here that can sell me their guide if they have one. Or if there is an expert than can write one up quickly I'll glady pay. It does'nt make sense to me to keep paying somebody over and over again.

As Karlos mentioned you are better off holding onto it for a while (3 months or so is ideal) - although that doesn't mean you can't make a nice profit holding it for a lot less (I hold most of mine around 2 weeks these days).

You buy a site in the very early stages of development perhaps even just the domain and you renovate it into the most profitable site you can possibly make it. It's like developing a real estate property - buy it cheap because it is extremely basic and then add to it to make it worth more. You put good content on there monetise it and promote it with backlinks. The "site flipping skills" you ask about are the ability to recognise what content it needs how to best monetise it and get it ranking. You can outsource some of this work but no-one is going to do all of it for just a cut of the profit.

Site Buying - I'm just wondering what are the basics? how much money is needed to begin how will I know if I can make money off A site? what things should I be looking for in a site and what things indicate whether a site is going to be profitable or not?. As from what I think i understand this is basically a form of Merchanting? Buying for less and selling for more or am I wrong and it involves more than just buying and selling such as improving the websites by increasing their traffic.

To buy a site at a low enough price that you'll make a decent profit after all your selling fees you need to find a site which is for sale well below the actual value - not easy on the larger marketplaces where you're competing with hundreds. There is some scope to buy an under-priced site and immediately sell for a higher price - this can usually be done where the seller has a poor sales pitch either by missing out some major selling points or by not emphasising them enough. However in most cases you will need to improve a site in order to make a decent profit. You could buy a site and increase it's value by driving more traffic to it improving the design or improving the ad placement to increase earnings. What to look for - basically look for a site you think you can improve and make more valuable. How much you need to start - it depends on whether you're starting at the lower end of the market or higher. You could start with as little as $50 (probably even less) but at that level it's going to be difficult to make any serious cash straight away unless you get very lucky. What indicates if a site is going to be profitable - basically if it has a poor design and could be improved by easily switching things around or if the site will be easy to drive more traffic to (eg starting to rank for some keywords or easy to get social traffic to) Make sure you do your due dilligence when buying. If a seller claims a site has 3k visitors per day you need to be able to see where those 3k visitors are coming from - eg is it ranking in the search engines? Is the traffic coming from social media? If a site makes $50/day then you also need to check whether the traffic supports the earnings. Also make sure the traffic/earnings are likely to drop (eg seasonal)

Good websites you keep unless you seriously don't want to mess with them any longer and even then it is probably better business sense to run them until they kill themselves. Very rarely does it make sense to sell good websites and if you look at what buyers are expecting to pay for such websites it probably makes even less sense bringing them to market.

If I was the buyer I wouldn't want to pay more than 8 months of its revenue when its only 2 months old and just recently started making what its making now.

That's what I've seen similar sites go for in there. If you do the auction properly and the site is decent 10-12 months is about the max you can expect to get for a new site so don't be too greedy.

My web design skills are very strong. I also know the seo basics such as on-page optimization back linking anchor texts etc. What is the best way to go about selling "New non-established websites." I know the asking price will always be lower than selling a site with proven profits and traffic. Are there any tips I can use to increase my selling price on new sites?? Also what is the deal with flippa?? Seems like that place is going up in smoke. Am I worrying for no reason? Thanks for reading all the way through guys. This is a great forum. I'm sorry I didn't give it a chance until just recently.

It is also about the niche of the website traffic rank and revenue. It does not have to be all of these things but its the due diligence that users look into when buying a website. I would recommend just researching a niche on Flippa to see what sites are selling good with tons of bidders. Once you figure that out and what type of site you are going to build then I would suggest just looking on Flippa for a cheap site in that niche that is already finished. If you are wanting to go on the road to more design then I would suggest learning how to design websites in photoshop. Pretty hands on but you have to have a creative mind.

The only income shown was generated from the wso sales. I guess the people just buy a simple domain and upload the wso sales letter and download page to it? Would this work? I have a WSO that already made a net profit of $676. Would the converting wso sales letter and quality product have value at flippa? I figure it should generate $1200 by the time it's all done. How much could I expect to get for it on flippa if I uploaded everything onto a domain?

I've heard that items such as polo shirts the unlicensed ones are usually made by the same people that used to work for the licensed ones, And even some former factories that used to work for them,start producing the items if they lose their contract. Which means the quality would be about the same as an officially licensed polo shirt for example.

It's the fact that the original companyhas to spend money on R&D and marketing usually costing in the millions. Where as replica's just have to find a similar method of producing the product, and then ride the wave of demand created by the original company. That's why a lot of governments/big companies are against it... If those replica based companies spent millions in R&D and marketing, then I'm sure they wouldn't mind as much. But since they are just ripping copyrighted products, it's not fair/equal.

This is quite common especially with brand new/newish sites to drop significantly after blasting them, then come back stronger. Your best course of action is to keep building links, and of course diversify instead of just 1 type of link. If you do a blast and it drops you then you get scared and stop blasting it is apparent you were creating backlinks for SEO, if the links keep coming in then it looks more natural. I very much doubt it has anything to do with them being wiki links as I regularly use our bots to blast post mediawiki and macosx wiki articles to all of our sites without penalty. Again though, its like everything else it should be part of your offsite seo campaign and you should make it as natural as possible and certainly not overdo it on a brand new website.

I don't build them and wait for a boost in the serps. Also i think your site is experiencing a dance, give it a minimum of two weeks and see.

Indeed, for blog comments i believe it is better to not ping them, it is more natural and don't raise any flags. You can assume that Matt Cutts has scrapebox on his computer and knows what you can do with it. If you ping them, it doens't look natural as Google will index "out of sudden" crappy blog comments with high OBL. I even extend this to many backlinks actually. I believe Google will find by itself what it needs to find.

Wiki backlinks are saturated very quickly. If you ever purchased any wiki backlink service from BHW or from fiverr or any other website, then you can see that after 10-12 days, only 10-20% backlinks or less active and rest all are dead or edited by any other persons or deleted by wiki sites. So take little precaution while building wiki backlinks.

But if you can use them technically then you will get some value. like have you used a lot of anchors? its necessary. remember it.

Because proxies for TM are very hard to find and IPv4 space is almost finished, there are a few providers out there that still have TM proxies ... If you want to keep your proxies for a very long time and NOT get them blocked by TM you will have to use only 1 TM account / proxy and never connect from multiple TM accounts with the same proxy, never mix them up always use the same IP for that particular TM account ... Best is to have multiple /24 subnets (254 usable IPs) and I will explain you why: if you have multiple, let's say you have multiple /27 IPs and there are any other TM users that use the proxies from the same /24 subnet as you have the /27 and they do something wrong, and they will get banned, your proxies will also get banned because ticketmaster is NOT blocking a particular ip, they ban the whole class of /24, if you do it in this way, the usage of your tm proxies is limited and depends on what the other tm proxies users do with their proxies ... try with a /24 you have, what i have told you and you will see what I'm talking about

Its because they probably had so many accounts, going crazy stuffing the sh*t out of people, ebay was paying them thousands and thousands of dollars, they probably stuck out like a sore thumb saying "hey ebay, look at me, im fucking you over and your paying me" So eBay investigates and BAM there they go, being sued. They will probably loose ALOT more then they EVER made on eBay, So for all you cookie stuffers out there, if there is one thing to learn from all this is that don't be greedy play it smart and blend in with the community.

Christopher Kennedy, 28, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge James Ware on Thursday to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud. He will be sentenced by Ware on Nov. 1. U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said Kennedy admitted in the plea that he created and sold a cookie-stuffing program on his website between January and November 2009. The program was known as "saucekit" and Kennedy's website was ww.w.saucekit.com. According to documents filed by prosecutors, the program enabled advertisers to deposit fraudulent "cookies," or Internet code, on the computers of people who used San Jose-based eBay's website for online auctions. The cookies fraudulently gave the advertisers credit for bringing about the computer users' online purchases, even if the computer user hadn't been directed to eBay by their advertisement, and even if the computer user never even saw the advertisement. As a result, advertisers that used the saucekit program were able to collect referral fees from eBay to which they were not entitled. The wire fraud conviction carries a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and a possible restitution order, but the actual penalty will be determined after consideration of federal sentencing guidelines. Kennedy was charged with the crime in February. He is currently free on a $50,000 bond while awaiting sentencing.

I could imagine when eBay is done with this they'll either raise their hands in victory and go, look at us - don't fcuk with us! OR they'll keep low profile and start recollecting all the money they paid out to affiliates - going to be hard though, unless that individual person lynched them for a lot of figures!

Blanking the referrer, using multiple accounts, proxies, et al can each be slammed as misrepresentation depending on your POV. And it's really a selective slamming of the little guys---script cookies, flash cookies and the like are dropped on visitors by the big sites all the time without their knowledge or consent. It's only when us small IMers did it to THEM that the hammer comes down.

If it was just given away there wasn't much they could do. When money gets involved though, the law applies. eBay is by far the worst of all of them. They own PayPal, and the culture they have developed in their business practices is criminal in itself. Only problems is, as someone pointed out, nobody has deep enough pockets or a big enough fish to fry with them. Anybody small, is crushed long before they can reach any such status.

My experience regarding your questions are below: A call center will be pretty aggressive regarding the number of hours they require to work for you each week so don't expect much flexibility. If you know you can keep them busy then it's the easiest process because they have the equipment and well-trained staff. You would simply give them the leads and the script. They will also cost more. In regards to individual telemarketers I ask everyone that applies for my job if they are applying for themselves or on behalf of someone else. A lot of call center managers respond to telemarketing ads and you won't know unless you ask. This is important to me because I speak to each person that wants to make calls for me via skype. One issue with individual telemarketers is they will often expect you to provide the dialer or pay for skype credits. I don't pay for either and I tell them that they must set their contract bid to cover their expenses. I always ask up front how they make phone calls to the U.S. Some use skype and others use magic jack. What I like about odesk is you can look at the applicants' work history as well as what they have been paid for similar work. You can see how many other projects they are working. You don't want someone juggling several jobs for this type of work. You can also see how often they've worked as a telemarketer and can use that leverage with you make an offer. Of course the reviews are critical as well. I've never had an issue regarding the phone number that shows up. The key is that your telemarketer has a good voice. If I like how they sound the next step is to send them a brief video explaining the project. In this video I tell them to be considered they must call five test leads within 24 hours of accepting this requirement. It's another way to weed folks out because you get a lot of applicants for this type of job. I also get free confirmed leads for my offer and it allows me to see if there's an issue with their equipment. I want folks "hungry" to work for me which is why I use this process. By the way both call center staff and individual telemarketers have completed these steps. I pay hourly for telemarketers and I check their work diary regularly to ensure they are doing what's expected. I immediately send a message if I see an issue.

Cold calling is the hardest of them all and no! not anyone can do it it is much easier calling a warm lead. With cold calling you will either get the phone put down or you will get a angry person on the line always better to call warm leads. Remember in the USA (cell phones) people are paying for their incoming calls. People are still cold calling (we do) but sblackhat007 is right it takes one hell of a good telemarketer to do it and to have the patience to sit over an 8 hour shift and call 100's of numbers with little result. I am not trying to be negative here (of courses I have no clue as to what the pitch is all about) just beeing realistic. I have found that to promot something/anything you have to believe in it enough to spend money on it (taking the chance) anyone who wants to pay per commission for cold calling with out a base salary or spending money to warm up the leads shows me that they are not serious in the product/serves they provide if you will not take a chance why should I Just my 2 cent

If someone here is confident enough that negative SEO works and they can prove it with a completely verified case study, let me know and I would be happy to help facilitate it. I am the author of this Penguin Post and our original Penguin post, and since our very large dataset is not showing any value in negative SEO I would absolutely love to do a case study that shows the opposite assuming there is someone on here convinced enough that negative SEO is possible. I tend to think a lot of people cry "negative SEO" because they are spreading FUD and trying to get Matt Cutts to be less aggressive with his updates (or because they are bitter or want to blame someone besides themselves when they get hit by an update), but mostly my opinion is based on the data I have seen and I am perfectly willing to change my opinion if we can do a case study that proves the opposite. As the owner of both Microsite Masters and WordAi, and considering how much traction my original Penguin Post got (Matt Cutts confirmed he read the post), any negative SEO case study we publish will certainly get in front of Google's webspam team, and I'm confident that if we were able to conclusively show that negative SEO is practical, the PR surrounding such a major discovery would make them reconsider parts of their algorithm, which would be good for everyone. So if you really think you can make this happen, PM me and let's set up a completely statistically sound case study where we conclusively determine once and for all if negative SEO is possible and practical. Otherwise I'll continue to go with the data I have which shows that Penguin is a link devaluation update and not a link penalty update and that negative SEO is generally impractical.

My sites literally only last a week or two at most so I don't really care about negative seo being performed on my sites in fact it makes me laugh that someone is going to the effort of trying to get me penalised when I know it will be anyway. Anyway these guys who are blasting my site are using keywords such as payday loan keywords and online casino keywords. Am I not right in thinking that's a total waste of their time? I don't want to rank for those keywords anyway or is that what people do for neg seo just blast random keywords to a site? Like I say, either way I don't care and if you're on here you sad bastard get a life and try and rank your own sites rather than concentrating on ruining it for others. Karmas a bitch
com_blackhatworld_www_337fb107fbf070dc8ccc47c028d0764b57b46a91_1422502670393,DD15-103,DD15-103.1,3,When a competitor blasts your site with thousands or 10s of thousands of bad back links, you're going to disavow ALL of them? Good point. Not only will people not disavow all of them, they can't. Google will not show each and every link pointing to a site that they find. The other paid tools do an even worse job. Blasting a site with porn, viagra, payday loan links appears to be a method that is still used, but this is the easiest form of negative seo to cleanup from. Anchor text sticks out like a sore thumb to the website owner and a Google employee can easily come to the conclusion that it was a NSEO attack. The most damaging form of negative SEO from backlinks is when they use the same anchors as the site is trying to ranking for. These links are much harder to identify and on a reconsideration request Google will find it difficult to release the penalty. Basically, NSEO attacks that use the keywords the site is trying to rank for will cause Google to not trust any of those links and even taints the legit links. The loss in ranks for sites getting hammered by this method may not be swift, but they are long lasting as I have seen. Panda, penguin, hummingbirdie and whatever lame updates Google releases are all part of a larger strategy to push people into Adwords and organics off of the first page of the serps. Allowing negative SEO to happen is also a part of this puzzle and the more people that get nailed by it the more excuses Google has to drop ordinary sites out of organic search. The sooner people realize what Google is really up to, the faster they can adapt.

If you waste your time and money killing every other site in front of you, it's time and money you didn't spend strengthening your own site - and THAT is a waste. ... also, just because you knock down the sites in front of yours, does NOT necessarily mean that your site will replace those you killed... could be that you're stuck in your current position for other reasons Finally, if you are ever going to go after the bigger, more worthwhile terms, you are going to find that neg seo has decreasing benefits - sure you can take out 1 yr old, pr2 sites - but that's not going to help you when you're going after a bunch of 10yr old pr6 - you should save your time and money working on better strategies that will actually make you some real money. if you don't learn, you won't earn

However, for years I've seen black hatters using black hat techniques to rank their websites. Emphasis on their. You work hard using black hat methods, and you reap the rewards. They (at least to my knowledge) never spent all their time and money trying to abuse techniques to destroy other people's sites. Since when has BHW been about that? As I said, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but if we all spent our time doing Negative SEO in an attempt to derail each other and rank higher in the SERPs, we'd all end up losing in the long run. Organizations with plenty of cash to burn would dominate the SERPs even harder than they do now. This is just my 2c. Couldn't really care if anyone agreed with me or not. Hopefully most black hatters distance themselves from Negative SEO. It's only damaging to all of us.

I've had it happen to more than one of my sites and what they did is over optimize the anchors with blog comments forum profiles and all the shit links they could find.

But it tends to only work with < PR2 sites. Meaning that if you NSEO'ed a site with a PR of >= 3 with a decent link profile then you will see the results that you have explained in your post. Also just because the term NSEO is new to a person doesn't make the 'n00bs'. In conclusion I'd still beg to differ. Very informative. Thank you for that. I retract my statement that they are not doing anything wrong after reading your reply and think you are right to differ. People should just build a company instead of destroying other peoples work. The reason I thought it was genius is that they were not actually hurting the target long term. Being new is nothing to be ashamed of I think but I did use n00b in a derogatory way because people that cheat to get ahead will always stay n00bs/newbies/amateurs in my opinion as there is no long time profits in it. Nothing to be proud of. To take money from such people while actually helping the competition is just genius to me hence my initial reply. I still don't want to attack this nSEO company though.

I won't give their name but they're currently number one for a particular term. I just ordered 50 000 scrapebox links from fiverr to be delivered all at once with the exact same anchor text. Cost me $5 LOL. I'm doing this to ruin his site so that my negative seo site can move higher up in the rankings (sarcasm). Lets see how it goes.

I ran numerous NSEO case studies (I'm still running them today) and it's been over 10 months. I blasted every site I targeted with a shitton of shitty overoptimized GSA spam and sent all the links to indexification. And I did this on a range of low competition to high competition sites. The least competitive site had a little over 200 links when I attacked it. Fast forward 10 months now it has over 600 000 links. It hasn't dropped as much as 1 position in the SERPS. Didn't even bounce or do anything. This has been the same story for every other site I attacked. Any negative effect you think you're seeing I'd wait a week or 2 and seriously reconsider what you think is happening. Because I haven't just tested this myself but I've spoken to various guys who are 100xs smarter than I am. Like "Iamnameless" from WaFo. And a few other guys who are deep in the SEO game. One had me sign an NDA and gave me a site of his own to attack. That's how confident he was I couldn't take it down. And he was right cause I've been trying for 10 months and it's been the same story as every other site I've gone after. The only way to NSEO a site you don't do it with spam. I'm not going to write how it's done because my post will be edited. But my point is negative SEO is not real. Not in the context you're talking about. -BB

(think San Francisco Plumbers etc.) *The website has a poor or limited BL profile. (think lack of authority EDUs/natural news etc) *The website is young than 24-30months (this is average guess from a study we did). How effective is Negative SEO? It's as effective as you want it to be depending on the investment and the time you are willing to put in. In some competitive niches I see up to 1 000 000 links with negative SEO pointed at competitors. Try cleaning that up with "disavow" tools! Should you do it? Well that's up to you but remember life is like a boomerang - what goes around comes around! Do it to others and eventually others will do it to you so be very careful my friends. Remember you are not competing against each other you're competing against Google so act as a gentleman would.

Yesterday I was looking at my backlinks on ahrefs and noticed a sharp increase the past few days to the tune of 500 links a day. I then looked at my anchor text cloud and saw that all these links had the following anchors: porn sex or viagra. I immediately freaked out and started to disavow all the links I have found as they show up. Is there anything else I can do? I am pretty sure it is the #2 guy ranking behind me in my niche. I saw that he started doing a massive link building campaign starting in early November and I wonder if he is pissed he can't supersede me and decided to try to attack me instead? Has anyone ever had this happen to them? Did it negatively affect your rankings? Do you think it will affect mine? I am trying to disavow the links as soon as they appear I just hope I am getting them all. These links have yet to appear in my Google WMT but I see them on ahrefs and other backlink tracking sites. I am concerned that after penguin that these links will be considered manual spam and result in a penalty against me I hope Google's algorithm is smart enough to realize that stupid porn links pointing to me have nothing to do with my content and realize I am being attacked. Thoughts?

High-end webdesign perfect code clean netlinking during years so my site went quickly on top of SERP for targeted keywords... Until someone starts a negative SEO campaigns which was against me and some others of my competitors. The guy who did that blast like 10'000 optimized anchors per domain. My website was 5 years old and had a good authority a PR4 but for almost all my keywords it dropped from #1 or #2 to #8 or more second and sometimes 3rd page. The websites with more authority than mine haven't been impacted but mine and some others competitors have been hit by this negative seo campaign. First of all I decided to not panic when I saw new poor links created back in december 2012. In january 2013 rankings starts to drop and it continues until negative seo campaign stop. Since then rankings increase a little bit but I think it's due to some of the links disappearing and negative seo campaign ending. During the last few months I tried everything : create new quality links disavow this bad links submit a reconsideration request. My work on it didn't change anything over the last 6 months. So now after many efforts what I should do ? Stay here and continue to spend hours focusing on my website and spend time due to someone's bad intention ? This is what I did first but now I am thinking of blasting fresh and young websites which took advantage of this negative seo campaign to get my website back to top. If you guys experienced that I would be pleased to share with you and learn from yur advices but please don't come here to say "focus on your own efforts" or something like that it doesn't work !!! Thanks

Their evaluation of what is "high quality" or low may be debatable, but the gist of the idea is fairly sound. If it were handing out penalties you would be seeing notices, rather it very well may just be devaluing crap, or suspicious links. This is great news for the future, as this stance will eventually make negative SEO completely impossible in traditional methods.

Here's the best part, by blasting my site like that they basically just handed me a great list list of aa sites to use against them, the only difference is that they were only able to get one of my sites because I'm not an idiot and don't link all of my sites together. So, I'm going to take all their shit down. Yes, in case anyone is wondering, I am a vengeful mother fucker. I have never crossed anyone or done anything unprovoked, but when someone crosses me I come back 10 times harder. My delimma is that quite a few of their sites are local businesses. I'm sure they run a shit little SEO company. Part of me wants to take those sites down with the rest, but I do feel bad about fucking with a local business like that, but on the other hand I know I could put this scumbag out of business. I am going to hold off on them for now. I'm going to start with 1 site and see how it goes. I will post the progress here and what I did as I get that info.

In fact in 2009 Google even went as far to say not to worry about low quality links.

It appears that people who do neg seo are considered to be a cross between a child molester and someone who kills kittens. Can someone tell me why? In a Black Hat World, what is the ethical dilemma?

I was using white hat (and occasionally some gray hat) SEO techniques, they don't give a shit about SEO... I was worrying that soon or latter their site will hit my on #1 position and i decide to blast them with some low (very low) quality fiverr blasts. I get 2 gigis of 50.000 post comments one each month for the last two month. Finally after almost 3 months they get position #1 and i'm now #2. I check their backlinks (as i do regularly) using Open Site explores and except some (no more than 10 backlinks...) from other sources (no high PR, no authority sites) all the backlinks they had (more than 30.000 according OSE) are from by blasts! Believe it or not i help my competitor, to be on position #1! They said that it is possible to do Negative SEO, my experiment has a different result. My "negative SEO" actually HELP this site to gain position #1! Think again if you plan to do this...

I wasn't making much money from the site, but I had put a lot of work into it. I ignored it at the time, as it didn't have any real impact on my day to day earnings because I have a lot of other things going on and figured I'd deal with it later. Well, now it's later. The niche my site is in is pretty obscure. I managed a few top spots for various keywords. Most of the other ranking sites were authority sites for this niche and had been around for years. None of them appear to do any real SEO (or are damn good at hiding their footprints) and I have had contact with a few of them in the past, so I eliminated them from my list of suspects. About a two weeks after I was blasted into oblivion a new site showed up for many of my previous keywords and here's where it gets interesting. I was digging through the new site and came across a link to a web2.0 page. Well, that account has about 10 pages, all of them have 2 or 3 outbound links to various sites. The linked sites cover a lot of different niches, from local florists to affiliate products. Now most of the spam links that hit my site were shitty blog comments on about 7 domains posted on 5 seperate days.

Theytend to maintain their site time to time for updates and extra security. I feel my money is more safer in LR compared to paypal because paypal can be easily hacked wherelse if you are using LR, you'll know how hard it is to hack it.

They are legitimate however they are a pain in the backside to fund and withdraw from and you have to be wary of the type of businesses that only accept LR as form of payment as you have no recourse if your defrauded.

I agree you can go beyond the list of recommended LR exchangers, if you have your own risk management system to protect yourself from scammers. It's also helpful for working with programs others don't like (hyips, et al), it's your life and your risk, after all. It serves the market well as a processor for international users who want to explore alternative moneymaking sites.

Its reallysecure but I find its a little harder to get money onto your account and can take longer. They dont accecpt credit card only bank transfer or western union but as far as I know they are pretty anonymous and arent a pain like paypal. The other downside is nobody accecpts liberty reserve but I think it would be great for blackhatrs for paying for services among each other.

You can't get refunds or trace the seller. From seller point of views, its the best one. The only drawback is that you can't withdraw money to your bank directly. You have to sell LR to someone else.

However, it can be used to send/receive payments anonymously and it does NOT require any kind of verification whatsoever. You can have multiple LibertyReserve accounts at the same time but from different e-mails (yes, it's allowed). It does NOT have any chargeback option. Once you send payment to a LibertyReserve account, it CANNOT be refunded under any circumstances. Funding and withdrawing money from LibertyReserve is a bit complex - you will need to use exchangers but if you can send bank wires then it's easy.

On the first page you give some information with a button selling "get more info" On the second page you give a little more info but hold some back for the optin. Your lander complies with Bing tos because you are not asking for anything. They (lead page) say that it increases conversions by building trust.

I know you cant on G and MSN. ---------POST 2--------- From: webdesign Date: 1342856220000 > They don't like pages that ask for an email as soon as you land on them but depending on the way the page is designed you could get away with it. In most cases though it's better to have a "in between page" for conversions - (ie making the user interact with your website in the form of a question or poll) before they're asked for their email. That way you'll have no problems with Facebook.

I can't say leaving the name off improves conversions to be honest and if you want a good list you need to have their names too. What I can say for sure is that personalised emails improve conversions.

I have to provide my email before I can learn anything else. That is not allowed" But they were fine with one campaign that was direct linking to a video that had about two sentences of content under it. Anybody else run into this lately? Is Bing just getting more stricter.. I knew this was the case with Google Adwords but I though Bing was a little more lax on that front. They said many accounts do this and while they work for the short term once the bot finds it the account gets frozen like what happened to mine. I figured a workaround would be to get a 500 word article added under the opt- in form..

I managed to get my account back in good standing by contacting them and getting someone to manually review/lift my account flag. If you look around the forum there are more people saying this same thing happened to them seems that they are getting more strict.

Just add content make it look like a normal landing page and not just collecting information and you are fine with that.

If they get as strict as google I'm going where the traffic is at! sagarbest and bitgrimmy yeah I'll just add some content. It is pretty thin and I guess with keeping the searcher in mind they didn't get exactly what they were looking for when landing on my page. I wouldn't spam since I want to keep my Aweber account but I can understand what Bing was seeing. I'm thinking an article or two will be good. I just love landing page styles with a catchy headline and some short text to build curiosity. They convert so good. But teaching them something right on the page may convert even better.

On the first page you give some information with a button selling "get more info" On the second page you give a little more info but hold some back for the optin. Your lander complies with Bing tos because you are not asking for anything. They (lead page) say that it increases conversions by building trust.

Total waste of money because; 1) they're fake accounts which means no one will ever read any of your Tweets sent to those accounts 2) you run the risk of having your account banned by Twitter when they discover these fake accounts (think foot prints) 3) If you've bought these to make your account look popular so that other people will follow you because your account looked popular then those real people will be of little value to you because they only followed you because you looked popular.

That's the 'crowd' mentality in action. What you want is people following you because of what you offer and what you can provide for them. Targeted traffic is worth 1,000 times what untargeted traffic is worth. It's worth remembering that when it comes to Twitter. Why spend your time focusing on methods that are just going to create more work for you while providing poor results and run the risk of having your Twitter account suspended too?

Use Capitalization and call to action (Buy Now!). Your current ad copy is too generic and I see no real USP. If I want a huge range and best prices I can order from Amazon ![](https://static.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/images/smilies/wink.png) So, how do you convince me to buy from you instead of Amazon or some other big retailer? With a better ad copy your conversion rate will definitely go up. And for the keyword match type I recommend you to use exact match & modified broad match. Also check the performance on mobile and desktop. If your site is not good on mobiles, switch off ads for mobile. There is so much you can do in order to increase the conversion rate. Also, check your website...is it clear? Do customers find what they are looking for? Can you improve the user experience?
com_blackhatworld_www_d3bcb5de3f9cac27803b442b852fc46973e0b179_1426568058005,DD15-108,DD15-108.1,4,It's not about quantity of keywords, it's their quality. You may be usingkeywords that are too generic thus getting lesser quality impressions and clicks. There are also settings you should look into such as search partners and display network which should be separate from the search network, if you are to use display at all. Your ads will influence your conversions as well as click rate but they go hand in hand. You will get more clicks by offering something they are looking for which helps pre-sell. So typically, higher CTR ads also get higher conversion rates. Test different ads to see what makes people click and buy. Your ads are bland and with better ones, both those rates will go up. But the landing page is what converts. The ads help get people in the door and pre-sell. The page must close the deal. You may not be doing this right. It's not about looking good but about convincing the visitor that you have the best value.

You'll learn nothing from being given keywords, and then you'll still have to create a decent landing page or find a relevant program. Then of course the good converting keyword could be crap for you because the program or landing page sucks. If you wanted to know some good converting keywords, go to google and type in some keywords. If there are ads, take a screen print. Repeat every day for a few weeks. Now see which ads are always present. The chances are, they convert. Now find another keyword and do the same. I suggest you do some work.

The key to being successful on this great planet Earth is learn and practice. Don't expect people to serve up a piping hot plate of high-converting keywords, just because you ask for them. People here will help you - it's a community. It's a process of give and get - not "give me now".
com_blackhatworld_www_0dea22146fc7e5b7d950af9837b8425df7985413_1422419238925,DD15-108,DD15-108.1,2,There is no such thing as a high-converting keyword by itself. There are keywords that convert for specific products, but there is no keyword out there that will convert high for everything. You need to have a niche and a product, then we can help you with high-converting keywords. You need the item you want to convert before you just go out and get the keywords. Amazon is a high-converting keyword for, you guessed it, Ama*zon.c0m. Is that what you want? And yes, viagra converts EVERYTHING, even Disney Movies.
com_blackhatworld_www_7a68da04bf0f46c57ab3b479ce145f67fb670043_1426569816420,DD15-108,DD15-108.1,4,First, instead of doing a crappy site as you call it, why not build the bestselling landing page you can and actually SELL your book? If by your own admission you have a crappy message, and not actually selling it, any conversion rates are basically meaningless. Next, any CTRs are also meaningless without more info. You can improve that and your Quality Score which is the real measure of your success against competitors. QS is also normalized to position. So saying "I'm getting a 3% CTR" doesn't mean too much. If your QS is 10, that's better information to know. Knowing your position would be useful too. As you said, sample size of 4 "sales" is too small. But a good start actually as that's a 3% conversion rate. And you say it's a crappy site so it seems you are doing a half-way decent job on your sales pitch. You may find however that some people don't actually complete the purchase. You don't know as you are showing them an error. I think it's a good start. You "broke even" on your first try. With improvements you'll bring your QS up which will drive your costs down and you should be making a profit. You need to learn much more about PPC however for that to happen. For one thing, keep search and display campaigns separate.

I also have a book there that I sell. There are others you can buy that may help. Perry Marshall is well-known and has one but I wasn't impressed with the 2004 copy I have, that's why I wrote mine. Brad Geddes has one too, never read his but you can find it in bookstores.

QS is what drives Adwords to rank yourads and determines what you'll pay. He's wrong however on not being able to use Adwords for affiliate marketing. Learn about QS and other stuff in my [Adwords FAQ](http://www.lucidwebmarketing.com/adwords-faq.html). As for the estimates, that's based on an average QS and for getting the top positions. So yes, those would be accurate with those parameters. You are using keywords in a competitive niche (some are too broad or irrelevant) where each customer is worth a lot. Conversions are dependent on how good your landing page is at convincing the visitor that you offer the best value.
com_blackhatworld_www_08d8d9f41df422c8bcd58e7a20394bb547497f4a_1426569334586,DD15-108,DD15-108.1,3,You have to find deals, and uniqe niches to get make alot of money. Doingdating or alot of other general cpa is very competive.
com_blackhatworld_www_08d8d9f41df422c8bcd58e7a20394bb547497f4a_1426569334586,DD15-108,DD15-108.1,4,If the keyword costs $0.20 and the conversion rate is 10%, you will spend $2for every conversion. Of course, that's a long-term average. It's not what's going to happen for every $2 you spend. If your revenue is more than $2, you'll make a profit. A 10% conversion rate is very high and I doubt you'll achieve that in this niche. Running a campaign for 40 clicks will tell you nothing long-term. You need to test all the time. Test different ads to see what works. I wait until 25-30 clicks for each ad before I can be relatively sure that the one with the higher CTR will consistently beat the other. Then I try another ad to try to improve the CTR and QS. This can go on a long time. You also need quite a few conversions for each ad. You can't go in and think you'll spend only a few dollars and see if this will work for you. Advertising is a long-term activity.
com_blackhatworld_www_08d8d9f41df422c8bcd58e7a20394bb547497f4a_1426569334586,DD15-108,DD15-108.1,4,People get stuck on getting the cheapest click price. Focus instead on ROI. If we sell the same or similar products and my page converts at 5% and yours at 1%, I'll be happy to pay more, provided I make a profit at that cost. For the same amount of clicks, I would sell five times more. What's more, since you would bid lower, your ad would be lower. That's the ranking formula at work which is bid times QS. Therefore, you'd get less clicks because less people bother clicking the lower ads. So for the same number of searches, I might get five times the number of clicks. At the end of the year, putting it all together, I would sell 25 times more than you simply by placing higher and a higher conversion rate. And I'm assuming here our ads are equal in click rate and click costs. I'd get a further advantage over you with better ads: more clicks, better QS, lower cost. Another thing people don't realize is that the higher ads also tend to get higher conversion rates. People don't want to shop around much. They'll buy as soon as they find what they want. This means the first ad has a better chance to get the click and the sale.

There are 4 primary factors to conversion rates. The ad itself (adcopy) and where the ad is placed (traffic). Even the best converting ad will get a low conversion rate if no one sees it that is interested in it. The other two factors are the Landing Page and the Sales page/follow-up.

But you have to take into account the possibility of changing your website interface to be more "selling"..

For example, don't force potential customers to register on to your website(allow them to check out as guests). Sometimes if you can cut down the number of checkout steps(maybe by allowing all the info to be added on one page), that would help the conversion rates.

This way I all my customer info is in one place and I get at least an extra 4% per sale through amazon associates.

Check the search terms that are bringing you your traffic, are they on topic? Will customers find what they are looking for on your site? Whats your page speed like? High bounce rates are often caused by slow loading times. i'd say working on lowering your bounce rates will be the quickest way to increase conversions

Use a wp cache plugin if possible. As for redirecting towards a prefilled cart, it is possible with some amazon plugins.

Traffic can spike or plummet, andthe same goes for conversion rates. It just depends on your niche and your messaging. If you're going full throttle on PPC during the holidays, I would at least recommend some holiday-related messaging (ie. "Special Christmas promotion!") With health and fitness, I could see: 1) higher traffic/conversion rates out of preparation for low activity and feasting, 2) lower traffic/conversion rates as people know they are being naughty right now and assume they can deal with it later, 3) some combination of the two For looking at seasonal traffic, Google trends/insights is your friend. For conversion rates, you can test the above premises by randomly varying your messaging

Obviously look at the competition vs search volume but fundamentally you want to pick keywords that are going to sell. Generic keywords have high search volumes but they also have low conversion rates because they are generic. For example: "digital camera". Only a small percentage of users who type this into a search engine will be looking to buy a digital camera. Most users will be info browsing. Compare this to "buy digital camera". Conversion rates are likely to be much higher for this keyword. I hope that helps

(Another explanation: if you can find ways to "focus" your ad text, you may discourage "browsers" while encouraging serious "buyers," resulting in an increased conversion rate; if you broaden the appeal of your ad text to draw a higher CTR, you'll often bring in a few more buyers but many more browsers.)

So probably customers aren't going to book online unless they've already hired you at least once before. Is that phone number one that's dedicated to getting calls from the website? If not, you may be getting phone conversions from the site, but if you aren't tracking them independently from other advertising, you may not realize your conversion has improved. Are your conversion rates really that bad? This service isn't going to convert at 50% - you may be topping out at about the best you can do (this is a service that's likely to get a lot of repeat visits to your website before it converts, as people think about it and shop around). I think any campaign you run needs to go for at least a full week, mon-sun to be able to compare with previous campaigns. As for tweaks to the website, you should be doing A/B testing with your changes, but small differences might not make dramatic changes to conversion. Suggestions: The "featured in" yelp, wsj etc - if you can, link to the references so people can check you out. Bonded? you should include your bond # add the video from your website to your google plus page Your facebook likes look pretty fake. - Try getting some real ones. I hope you are also dedicating some of your budget to trying to rank organically in google local? your conversions may be better in organic listings, and your ROI will definitely be better

Google scans the landing page each time and if it can see that users are not finding the page useful, it penalizes you. Have you tried testing different variations using a split test? Is your action clear enough? Are your keywords prominent on the page? Do you deliver on your value proposition on the page (that was promised in the ad?). Is your conversion funnel easy to navigate? Maybe you can find some tips here, [http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/desig...ase- conversion](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/13-landing-page-tricks- increase-conversion)

Best to target siteswhere your prospects are likely to be. Your CPC may be higher but your conversion rate will be higher too. Being generic, your 5% may be optimistic. This will depend on your ad and your landing page's success at converting. Targeting more specifically, you will get a higher conversion rate, again your ad and landing page will determine this but 5% and even way more is achievable. If you properly target, enticing ads and great closing landing page, no reason to think that 40% of sign ups will be fake. In fact, build your sales funnel properly and you should get very little percentage of fake or less interested visitors. You also think 80% of people will ignore your sales team. Again, why do you think that? If trained properly and with quality leads, no reason to think that. They are also part of the sales funnel. Using your numbers, then you have a profitable campaign, even if doing things badly. You make 30k by spending 5K for a 25k profit (less other expenses I assume such as your sales team). Don't know exactly what and how you will be doing this, that's why I asked. If you do things in a better way, you could go even further with a higher profit.

The conversion rate for display campaigns, especially in your case, it will be way lower than you anticipate. In theory, a sign up landing page could get a 5% conversion rate but definitely not with Display - unless you`re Amazon that deploys over 200 monthly A/B testings a month to have such a conversion rate or offer something for free/test/trial. Also, if you want to stick with display as for your plan, you will need to know how to do it right: manual placements, correct targeting, frequency etc etc. A lot of people contact my agency on a daily basis with many concerns regarding the results they can get because, just like you, they tried it, with no experience what so ever in AdWords, Analytics and UX and failed. In the end, I would like to say that you should researching this a little bit more, put it on paper, precisely what you want to do and see afterwards if it still gets you the same ROI.

But as a genral rule if something is working on Google it should work just as well on Bing at a lower CPC. With 70 - 80% of searches happening on Google you can expect CPCs on bing to be 20-30% cheaper. If you want set in stone answer you, you answered it your self. You are going to have to throw some $$ and test, test, test.

So all you have to do is place the links in and hit create and your done. I've also created an Image spinner that will vary on many HTML elements while keeping only one src="" section so it wont sloooooow down your Spinner. Thinking about charging for it as it saves me about 30-45 min. I'm thinking about $5 a month What would this be worth to you guys?

Would love to hear your opinion on this (from those who currently using any article spinners and see the results of their work) - share with me your tips/suggestions and observations! I have seen lots of article spinners, a bit lost in choice/options. The most important to me is get high quality content and not be caught as duplicate by Google. Money plays secondary role so I am more than happy to pay more if I can get higher quality. Must be available on Mac. If Win only I am able to run it on Win7 that sits on my VirtualBox (as long as it will work without glitches).

Unique content and articles are best for getting ranked on Google and have no chance of being penalized. If you want to use spinning tools, I suggest you to use paid tools. They are far better than free tools. Also proofreading is require. Completely re-write the title of the article.

Your articles will end up being easier to read and more natural sounding, and the degree of uniqueness will be greater. Free article spinning software, in particular, produces articles that make little sense and the amount of time you need to invest in rewriting the article makes the actual spinning process pointless. Even software that you pay for simply can't measure up to what an educated, skillful person is capable of creating, so seek out individuals here and on freelance websites instead of software.

Meaning if you spin the word "guitar", you could end up having "electric guitar" or even "harmonica" because spinner tools or software think that you're article is solely based on musical instruments. Try SpinnerChief because it's free! You just need to delete some unnecessary synonyms and you're good to go!

It definitely is a fair amount to ask for a spinner. However if you are saving yourself money on every article because you don't need to pay somebody to manually do it, I would say it pays for itself. If you think paying $0.70/day extra for a spinner that can generate readable spintax is too much, there isn't too much else I can say. Unfortunately since the development costs for creating a spinner that has all that AI is pretty high, the price also has to be a little higher. It is not quite at the point where it is grammatically perfect all the time, but it probably will be by the time it gets out of beta.

Each article consist of snippets of text woven together from a large PLR database. Yes, they are readable, but most of the articles I tested did not pass copyscape. Bear in mind that they are shared amongst 100's/1000's of other users. They are definitely not 'quality' articles but may be of use to a 'lazy' SEO'er. I have not seen any 'good' article spinning services, that can beat a good manual paragraph/sentence/word level spin.

Just to try out the quality of this method, I wrote one 150 word article, with 6 sentences. All 6 sentences have at least 10 sentence variations. All sentences have every second or third word spun with at least one additional alternative. Some of the words have up to 4 different variants. I just wanted to see what kind of results this will give me. So far, it has been awful. Just after generating 8 articles from this super spin article, I am starting to see copyscape duplicates when I check against the private index that I have created. I mean, even a sentence level spin should give me at least 10 unique articles as I have basically written 10 different 150 word articles. Generally, the best spinner just doesn't spin enough at the word level.It just spits out the same sentence again and again. It is so frustrating. There is nothing wrong with the spintax format either. Any suggestions? I thought I will get at least a 100 variations out of this.I got stumped at 8. Just awful. What am I doing wrong? How do I get the Best Spinner to choose more randomly?
com_blackhatworld_www_0ca742fd118ef626d230dc6915574d60dd43f770_1422458442590,DD15-109,DD15-109.3,4,From: kvmcableDate: 1328119920000 Without looking at your article it sounds like you're not selecting enough syns at word level. CS checks for exact match on 4 word phrase (some say 3 now but I haven't seen that personally). So if you're only selecting 2 variants in a 4 word phrase you'll have a duplicate after just 2 spins. To achieve the level of uniqueness you're looking for you need to choose a lot more syns and many in a 4 word grouping. The more options you provide in a 4 word phrase the more spins you'll see before a match. To pop out 100 with low duplicates you need to selected 3-9 syns almost per word. I think you're just not considering the way CS looks for matches
com_blackhatworld_www_0ca742fd118ef626d230dc6915574d60dd43f770_1422458442590,DD15-109,DD15-109.3,4,From: kvmcableDate: 1328120760000 Also, there are several tools out there but here is how I accomplish what you're attempting. I use instant article shuffler ($5 at fiverr) and write my paragraphs as tips averaging around 3-5 short sentences, 60-80 words. I spin the hell out of each of these tips and test them in tbs making sure they're spinning and rotating. I'll also use tricks like blank pipe to remove a sentence and nested spins to rotate sentences. Now understand rotating doesn't fool CS as the words are the same, it fools humans. Of course dropping a sentence on every so many spins will change the CS hit rate because words are disappearing. Once I spin each tip and have at least 20 good ones spun every way of Sunday then I use the shuffler to make me articles. It will pull random tips and you tell it how many per article and how many articles you want. I've found this works better than relying on tbs to shuffle paras, sentences and words. Essentially this just leaves tbs with the task of spinning words. IAS finds the paras. This allows me large groupings of unique content on niches not hammered by everyone with automated article tools. I can pick any niche, research, in my spare time build tips and when the right domain comes along I've ready to rock. One other tip: I use the subscribed version of dupefreepro. For $10 you get all the add-ons and for this task it's a time saver. I can spit out 100 articles and tell it to compare each article against the others and in less than a couple minutes I know my best hitters with most unique. Those I grab for site content and take the others and toss in AMR. DFP does much more than that and I think it pays for itself every month just with the money I save in CS fees. I'm not an affiliate of DFP but I know what you're trying to accomplish and just sharing how I do it. HTH

If you have 6 versions of each sentence you already have a lot of variations, so you can be a bit easier on the word level. As you spin at word level make sure that each word creates a still readable sentence. Your result will be a lot better. If you want to get human readable content stay away from the auto spinner. It takes longer, but you will have an article that is completely readable when spun as many times as you want. It takes me well over 8 hours to spin a 500-600 word article by sentence and then by word. However the result is always readable. Unfortunately people won't pay an 8 hours wage for a quality spun article, so if you do it on fiverr for $5 or on oDesk for some other small amount just sentence spin it and use the automatic spinner :P

I don't need this site/program to do anything except spin my articles, which I already write in spinnable format. I've looked around and even downloaded a few things, but I found all the programs/sites that take normal articles and replace the words with synonyms that don't make sense. I can write a 300 word spinnable article in about 15 minutes so I'd rather do that, if I can find an option to spin it for me. Thanks.

Let's say your topic is about "bodybuilding". The points would be macronutrients, micronutrients, meal timing, exercises, type of food, etc. - For each points, write 200+ words around it - Rewrite each sentence 4 times, minimum. And by re-write I don't mean; {I love eating apples|I like having apples}. That's redundant. You'd want to rewrite each sentence in a way that they do not sound to similar, but still delivering the same broad message. - Manual word spin You will end up with a big seed article. The idea is to pick random points/micro-topics from the seed article (there's a tool for this). So, you could end up with an article about meal timing, exercise and supplement; and other times, you could end up with an article about exercises, lose fat, and gain strength. I hope you get the point.

You must be able to rank for some pretty competetive keywords with a network of links that big. I have to admit though I followed your concept last month for a keyword I was targetting. the network itself probably has around 7 or 8 web 2.0's but they are receiving a lot of links each from article networks etc. If your content is good (or at least unique) and your getting backlinks to your backlinks (social bookmarking at the very least) then it works great.

With that said, are there other options? I want to rewrite on a word, phrase and sentence level. Maybe even switch around paragraphs occasionally. Currently, I use WAC to just create a bunch of spun stuff. I think it is quite good, but don't submit to article directories and web 2.0 properties because the mass produced stuff is not what I would read myself. It too frequently looks like ESL or, now that I know better, spun stuff. Anyway, I put my WAC stuff out there with GSA SER. I think I want to rewrite my own articles and then build links to those articles with WAC and GSA. I think I can still do commenting to my main site with GSA, but will take more control over my Web 2.0 and ariticle submisisions that connect directly to my main site. I don't really need a spinner, I have WAC, but I do need a great rewriter. If the rewriter also spins that is fine, but secondary in importance. What are my options? Also, does commenting with WAC generated comments seem OK to my money site, but leaving the article and web 2.0 stuff for me. What about running GSA and WAC on my web 2.0 and article submissions. Is that a decent linking strategy. After thought: Are there any rewriters that also submit to properties that take article type content. (Web 2.0, blog, article directories) I'm pretty happy with WAC and GSA, if i can get a rewriter that also submits would I be able to forego an investment in Ultimate Demon or SE Nuke???

My idea was to take an article, completely rewrite it by hand 2 or 3 more times saying the same thing in different words, and then use article rewriting software (spinner) to randomly put one of each of the paragraphs in the appropriate spot while spinning the words within them at the same time. That way, the article is spun really good. I've actually done it and it says the article is spun 100%. Whatever the case may be, it should be a challenge for the filters to spot. My concern is that when I generate over 200-300 articles, I don't think they can all possibly be 100% different from each other. But if I can maintain a 35% difference between them then I will have the majority of them count as originals which will help my page rank. Well, that's the theory anyways... Do you guys think that will work to dodge the filters and get credit for a bunch of original articles?

I wish there was as it would make our life much easier. My basic process for rewriting an article is : 1. Write the article -- Either original or a very good rewrite. I never take someone else's article and spin it--not because of morals, but just because it doesn't work as well in the end. 2. Spin Paragraphs -- It depends on how many times I plan to use this article, but for a 500 word article, I'll create as many as 5~10 different versions of each paragraph. I'm a fast writer and this doesn't take that long for me to do. If you aren't as fast, or you won't be using the article that many times, don't spend that much time. 3. Spin Sentences -- Once I get down to sentences, I fluctuate a lot because at this point there's a lot of them. I'll write maybe five different variations and a lot of times less. It depends on how many times you think you can say the same thing differently. 4. Optional Paragraphs / Sentences -- Using a blank spin, I like to go back and add some optional paragraphs and sentences. This is the end of my "block" editing. This really helps improve the uniqueness of my articles. 5. Word spin -- If you want readable, you'll have to do it yourself. It's a pain, but it's worth it when your article turns out legible. I also add a lot of optional words during this process. Careful here because you have to keep in mind the grammatical structure in the sentence--you can easily gaff and mess it up by picking a wrong type of speech. By doing this all by hand, I can guarantee that it can be read by a human and not immediately filtered out as spam. It takes a lot of extra effort but the results are good. I can get over 90% uniqueness consistently while still being legible. The key to spinning your article and not having the final result read like it was spun is, sadly, putting a whole lot of effort into the preparation process.

I don't believe that the usual built-in thesauruses that spinners come with are good and fast enough. Why do I think that? After reading many many discussions here, on BHW I realized that spun content should be highly readable. The only way to achieve that is by manually selecting synonyms. I'm no spin-master, my structures are usually only 15x what the output article is, but it is a real hell to select synonyms manually even with such small constructs. Because of that I want to create synonyms to phrases. E.g. I've got a sentence "It's an amazingly simple idea (...)". So I take "an amazingly simple", check what are the synonyms to "amazingly" and "simple", write them down, combine them using combinewords.com and get a list of synonym phrases that I can favor and next time when I spin a text automatically with favorites it will get selected. There is one problem with that: one of the synonyms is e.g. "an incredibly simple". So I want the spinner to learn (when I input the list of synonym phrases) all of those phrases and favorite them automatically, so when it finds "an incredibly simple" in another sentence it would select all of the synonyms I've added to "amazingly simple." Because of that I'm looking for an application that can do two things: read a list of synonyms so I don't have to add them one-by-one,automatically learn added synonyms. Does such a tool exist?

Most services that offer spun articles at 75%+ unique will usually fail at some level (at least it did for me) because the work is outsourced to lower quality workers (how else does the service provider make money?) Quality article spinning is something I've been looking a long time for. It's my most time consuming task and the hardest service to find (one that meets my expectation). A spun article can fail for any of these reasons: 1) Original article written is bad quality (I'm guessing most services outsource this part to their writers for $1.5-$2.5 based on the quality I've seen) 2) The rewriting is bad quality. (This happens when the article is rewritten for the sole purpose of spinning. The quality is horrendous) 3) Bad spinning. Even if the spinning itself is good, due to the 2 points above, the resulting "super spun" article is going to be pretty shitty. I no longer hire services that make super spun articles for me anymore. I've started doing it myself because I got so frustrated at how unreadable my "readable spun articles" were. Sometimes I'm too embarrassed to even post it as my tier 2. The best way to get highly unique spun articles is to break down the steps and find someone good at each stage. 4 Simple steps I follow now (working great so far): 1) Purchase a well written article based on my keyword -> $5-$7. Try to use a writer you've used before that delivers good quality 2) Go to iWriter and select "Have articles re-written" and get 2 rewrites -> $4.25 x 2 = $8.50. In special instructions, mention that you want the sentences written in completely different structure from original but you want the sentence count to match and remain the same. Hint: With iwriter, you only have to accept re-writes that are good quality... 3) Go to fiverr and search for a manual article spin. Order a seperate gig for the 3 articles (original + 2 rewrites). $5 x 3 = $15. Make sure the gig offers the spintax (some won't for whatever reason). You only need word/phrase level spinning here. I recommend trying out different gigs until you find one that provides a nice readable word/phrase spin. (I value readability over uniqueness here because if I need more uniqueness, I will simply order more rewrites). 4) Take the spun articles, paste them into a separate Microsoft word document. Press ctrl+F, switch to word replacement tab: Search for all occurrences of (without quotes): "^p" and replace with "^p^p^p^p" This replaces all the paragraph breaks with a bigger paragraph break. Next you want to search for (without quotes): ". " and replace with ".^p" This puts all the sentences onto a new line. Now all you do is simply take each sentence and put them together. Takes about 5-10 min. Voila! A high quality, relevant, readable, and grammatically correct super spun article for under 30 bucks. It's well worth it if you're serious about your business. I do this for my tier 1 and sometimes tier 2. Never had a problem getting the articles indexed and building up PR. Easy way to get unique high quality contextual links back to your site. I also recommend setting up blogs that you post all your high quality tier 1 articles to. They really start to build up authority and natural links since these articles offer real value. I also use wordai now to spin my tier 2/3 articles together sometimes. The quality is pretty good but it's still "spun looking" and has awkward phrases for certain topics/niches/articles. But I would highly recommend wordai too if you're not particularly keen on having super good quality. I don't use it for my tier 1s though because my tier 1s drive traffic too and not just act as backlinks. Hope this helps someone out there. I know I've been struggling to find a good "all-in-one" spinning service for a long time (never did), so I'm assuming others are going through the same.

Then spin as many words in each sentence possible. This takes a really long time, but it is giving me about a 90% unique spun article that is perfectly readable and would pass as Tier 1 content since I am hand spinning all of this myself. in the end i should have one article i can use hundreds of places. another tip is to include and exclude some sentences by using {this is the sentence|}. That empty space after the | means the sentence may or may not be used. I am thinking of trying this with short paragraphs too, which really mixes it up!

I've been submitting to AMA, UAW and Isnare but doing it all by hand. When I spin by hand I'm not just replacing words with synonyms; I feel like my article are much more unique because I change the whole meaning of articles by writing completely different paragraphs (with different meanings). For example in AMA I might write a paragraph saying "it doesn't matter what brand of clothes you wear as long you know what kind of person you are". (just an example) and in Isnare I will write "it does matter what you wear because it's a reflection of you" and then write a whole paragraph why image is important. I'm not just replacing words but rewriting the whole damn thing. Do you think that's worth it or a waste of time and better off using a spinner even though the article wont be as high quality?

I was just wondering what kinds of features you'd like to see in an article spinner? Also, does anyone know of any more advanced spinners that do more than {simple|easy} rotation? Aside from the obvious thesaurus and simple spinning, I think it would be neat to have other random features such as: random characters (may be useful for CL posters)random numbers within a range (ie, 0-999)order a list of given items randomlypick a random item out of a listetc.. Anyone else have any ideas? Would anyone be interested in an advanced spinner like this or am I wasting my time?

You want to include 5 tips. You would actually write, say, 8 tips. Hopefully the SW would also allow the typical phrase/sentence spinning via {|} type replacement, so each tip would be rephrased in multiple ways as well. Then, during spinning, the SW could pick 5 of the 8 (or how ever many) tips at random, in random order, and with rewritten text. Does that make sense? Each new article version would contain a subset of the tips/unordered list, in random order, with no repetition. I think that would go a long way to changing the text vectors in an article, making it appear much more unique. Just a thought. Also, it would be great to have spinning software that could save your commonly reworded phrases, so that eventually you could rewrite a lot of an article just by picking various phrases from a list (synonym replacement but on a phrase level). I think there are some programs that do that currently, but I am not positive. I have been experimenting with using Excel, as two article spinners I tried both produced dismal results compared to a simple "alternate sentence" replacement scheme (takes 5 minutes to create in Excel...). Of course that doesn't have synonyms, but it does have a way to save common phrase rewrites as a list - but I have to manually copy/paste, which is annoying...

However, I was looking at the videos for Magic Article Rewriter and it appears to be very similar to the Best Spinner and have all the same features. I also like the fact that it's a 1 time payment and not a yearly charge. Plus, I have a Clickbank account so I can just buy it through my own link and get it for 50% off which would only cost me about $23 total. So right now I'm leaning towards Magic Article Rewriter because it will be around $50 cheaper than TBS and I also own it outright and don't pay the yearly fee. Before I do that though, have any of you used both of these and can you comment on the difference between the two? Which one did you like better and why? Does TBS have some extra features or functions that MAR doesn't have that I need to know about? Thanks for the help.

There is no 1 click spin that can do every single word unless you manually program your thesaurus for every word in the english language and even then when you manually program the thesaurus you need to consider EVERY context that the word or phrase can possibly come in. Some words/phrases therefore will be impossible to replace particularly some common words - pronouns prepositions conjunctions. Currently 1 word in 5 is nowhere near enough. You may as well not have a spinner if you do that. TBS is a waste of money if you want to program your thesaurus at a reasonable speed you should get Spinchimp it has all of the features of TBS and more it spins unlimited length seed articles and the interface is a lot like microsoft word which means it's very quick compared to TBS to do anything thesaurus programming included. With Spinchimp the 1 in 5 word thing is the same at the default configuration of "Best" quality spin that means in order to have the best quality 1 click spins with whatever software you use it will involve HARD WORK on your part. Spinning is indeed a big part of auto content generation and it takes some heavy balls some gruelling work something which TBS sales page would never tell you in order to actually make a 1 click auto spin work and stand a chance of being considered reasonably unique by SE's.

Don't just straight up spin the article out. SPin out entire paragraphs and such too. Rewrite the entire article by hand first in a similar structure. Then spin out entire paragraphs from each article into the next. The more rewrites you do prior the more unique your end articles will be. I've done some articles where I start with as many as 4 or 5 initial rewrites. I'm pretty paranoid about spinning content myself. So I like to spin in and spin out on numerous levels. Sometimes I set it up so the spin will include or exclude entire sentences and paragraphs etc etc. ex. {you sentence|your sentences 2|} So 33% of the time that sentence doesn't even show. My suggestion don't JUST use TBS's auto-spinning feature. It is good but take some time to build upon what the auto-spinner gives you. The more time spent the more unique your end product will be.

A recent example would be that I produced a piece of spyntax for SEnuke which generates an article of between 550 and 1400 words with variant pictures layouts and formats possible. Properly readable to humans. In size twelve font it took up 53 pages of A4 and SEnuke only just about managed to run it. That said all but 2 of the articles I put up last week from that piece(each with 2 backlinks to appropriate sites in the link structure im using) stuck and are now indexed. I intend to use that piece of spyntax ever week for the next year or so and get away with it. Now it did take a very long time to "code" that article but in the long run surely its worth it once I have a couple of dozen of those I wont need anymore for a looooong time and it will let me focus on other things. The site in question now ranks in its mid teens for a VERY competitive keyword phrase after a months worth of work. I would rather spin high stuff that will stick and takes a long time to produce then crap auto spin that will get taken down if a mod see it. I know some people will laugh at that but isnt quality content the mantra of the search engines ?

In other words the old spinning technique of replacing words or an almost one for one basis doesn't work like it used to. So if you're going to spin articles well I think it best to alter the various components of the hash. My thoughts then run to something like using 50 paragraphs of various length and then spinning them into a variety of 20 paragraph articles then spinning the words in the new articles. BTW if you're going for 10K sites and have the ability and tenacity to do so why only go with 100 articles that you need spin 100 times each? Why not shoot for somethinglike 1000 articles that each get spun 10 times? [small sarcasm filer ON] Isn't the web big enough to steal-n-scrape 1000 articles instead of a mere 100?

Do you know of an article spinner that can reorder paragraphs this way: BEFORE AFTER Paragraph 1 Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 Paragraph 3 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 4 Paragraph 4 Paragraph 5 Paragraph 5 Paragraphs 2 3 and 4 were selected and their order is to be randomized. (4 turns out to be in the same place). Note that only some of the paragraphs were selected. The Spinner interface would have to be: select paragraphs and then start a wizard to spin the permutations. The above example might spin into something like {{2|3|4}|{2|4|3}|{3|2|4}|{3|4|2}|{4|2|3}|{4|3|2}}. There are n! (n factorial) permutations when all paragraphs are selected. I would expect to be able to select a subset (say 2 out of the 3 in the above example). For larger (n) these can result in large (MB) spun files. I am in the market for a spinner. This is THE feature I am looking for. I view spinners as glorified word processors. I expect it should work for lists too. Outputing to files and trimming to length would be good. Spinchimp has random paragraphs reordering BUT ONLY (in the video) for degenerate selections like the one above; you do not select which items to reorder. Ubercubez construct spinner claims to do it but it is a web tool and is $27/month. SpinnerChief does not mention it. I have written an Excel application for the above which I used with XRumer. If I have to write my own spinner I plan to name it "Microsoft Spinner". ---------POST 2--------- From: moonlighsunligh

Here is how you can do it: First remove the blank lines between the paragraphs using any program like TextPad for example. In TextPad you can use 'Replace...' function (Find what:\n\n Replace with:\n till all extra blank lines are removed).Copy this entire text and place it in Excel in the B column.In the A column top row use rand() function >> =rand()Copy this cell. Then select all rows (if your article has 20 paragraphs then select the 20 A rows in front of it) in A column without losing the selected first cell's selection. (That cell should show the running-dotted selection line around it while other rows are selected in that column).Then press the Paste button while the range is still selected. This will paste the formula of cell 1 into all the selected cells.Now select only those entire rows that you wish to randomly shuffle. In Excel these rows need to be one after the other (sequential) only. For example if you wish to shuffle row numbers 3 to 7 then select only those entire rows.Then click the Data menu and use the SORT button to un-check/un-tick 'My data has headers' box if it has a tick-mark in it.Sort the selected rows as many times you wish. Only the rows that are selected will get shuffled randomly and all the other rows will remain in tact in their respective places.Copy the entire B column (your reshuffled article) in to any text/Word program.Done! You can save this Excel file for further use. Use any other article you wish to do the paragraphs-shuffle -- copy that article in the B column of this Excel file and repeat the process. You can select any number of sequential rows to change/shuffle the sequence of those selected rows only. Once you do the process for the first time it become a very simple process next time onwards. HTH. May be the good programmers of SpinnerChief will make this process available in their spinner application as this logic can be easily coded by them in no time at all! Hmm... And hopefully I will be given a free Pro version to use too for giving them this idea. ;-) P.P.S.: Getting back those extra blank lines in the article after the process is done is also easy. Paste the article in TextPad and use Replace... function once again. This time Find what: \n Replace with:\n\n. Remove the unwanted extra blank line at the bottom of the article.

The resultant files are perfectly functional but completely unreadable by homo sapiens. Thanks for relating your knowledge. I do not think it so hard to code as our spinners have a natural (programmatic) way of identifying things to be spun; they are non-blank lines. That last definition means that xyz will also work. I also imagine that you could make something like this work with the first layer of curly brackets and therefore use multiple lists. Yes the file size gets big.

Maybe something free or cheaper than $67/month? Thanks in advance. 1) Yes - but this is what I do. I spin the content really well. I end up with about 95% spun. I spin 4 articles together with different numbers of paragraphs. I spin each sentence and then each word/phrase. They are always 100% readable. I write generic rubbish where I can find a replace the keyword e.g. "why I like red" then find and replace red with blue green yellow purple whatever. This way I get different titles main keywords numbers of paragraphs numbers of sentences different sentence structure and then finally different words each spun copy 100% readable. Takes some time but I've used on article 1000s of times never cause me any problems. 2) The better the spin the more you can use. 3) I used to use AMR but now it's gone to $hit even though I scraped lists and stuff. Now I manually submit to the best 20 or so. If you already have an account it takes like 1 hour or less. Ezinearticles articlesbase etc. 4) tips on using spinning software - take your time. I read the sentence again and again. I too have to make a few adjustments here and there but not often.

My VA is spinning it word by word and I am sure there may be some One click solution? Also can I get nested spin(Best spinner) to provide spin tags for the entire article with one click? This question is a HUGE one; and it really depends on whether you're looking for 'one-click' or 'some' work or a lot of work... And guess what they all yield VERY different results. One-Click - or 'Auto-Spintaxing' will yield a 20-40% autospin usually at medium-high quality (medium to high in auto-spinning terms!) NEVER use the low quality autospins as you'll end up with complete unreadable junk. After Auto-Spintaxing you'll need to edit to remove the stupid/nonsense spins and then you'll have something which does a basic job; but probably won't get that many iterations/versions indexed. The next step is doing proper sentence-rewrites of each sentence and then spintaxing them. You get much more variety and it starts to actually read/flow differently and you'll get better indexation and stick-rates; espcially on 2.0's. The PROPER way is to use 3D/Hyper-Spinning; like with our UberCubez system. Which means multiple sentence re-writes with paragraph order substitution and re-ordering on top of completely unique titles for EVERY post as well as the bio/keywords/anchors fully spun to reduce submission/timing footprint as well. See: http://www.ubertoolz.com/UberCubezCreation.html & http://www.ubertoolz.com/demo/UberCubez.php Since the Panda updates of 2011 diversity in everything has become incredibly important for indexation and stick-rate. Quality is now more than just a throw-away phrase used by IM'ers; it actually means that your content needs to be better and more original to get it indexed and keep it there. Don't think that quick auto-spun crap on an auto-blog or something will cut the mustard anymore.

Yes the spinners are getting better but you will not get the same quality out of the system that you put into it. TBS et al are great for manual spinning but I personally believe automatic spinning is a waste of time. If a human can see contextual errors so can the search engine bots. They (G) even make it obvious for you that they care about it - content readabililty is one of the advanced search fields. You have to remember that the latest series of major updates have all been about content and removing this type of low quality articles from the index. I am not saying 'don't do it' I am simply trying to point out that your ROI on this effort has now reduced to what it was late last year.

I also write my own content just so I can play around with various LSI's and related keywords that I want to target for future campaigns with the same article. If I want something that'll last me a LONG time I hand-spin (human readable/high uniqueness) on the wordphrase->paragraph level. I also rewrite each paragraph but keep the keyword densities for that paragraph the same then spin those two together. So for each block paragraph there are actually two separate paragraphs. I sometimes even go further than that depending on how often I want to use that article. I do this to keep the flow of the article at a relatively decent quality while being able to spit out a very large amount of articles without worrying about search engines and duplicates. I guess my reasoning behind this is I might as well future proof things in case Google comes out with some new grammar algo. I can't quite find a program to judge the uniqueness of it accurately... Article Marketing Robot says the article I am currently spinning is at 700% uniqueness. ._.

Part of Speech tagging is a new field in Natural Language Processing and it's never been completely nailed. Even if perfect Part of Speech identification existed you wouldn't be able to guarantee perfect grammar in spun output because of the sheer complexity of the English language. The best you can do is do an auto-spin and check the output for errors manually.

There are some in the low 50's and others in the 80's for copyscape.. Reading through other BTW threads I think I'm of the understanding that this will be ok anyway and I've been advised by ryan that I shouldn't worry about it??? I don't really understand why I shouldn't worry if google doesn't like duplicate. Surely this won't help me? I'm not sure whether to proceed with it as it is (around 3 synonyms for each word) or to keep spinning each word AGAIN with the super replace function. Confused.. ---------

Great for anyone who is developing their own system involving article spinning. Supports nested spinning to infinite levels. If you're sending articleranks.com spins to it, just convert "[" and "]" to "{" "}" ... and "~" to "|". BTW I wrote this myself. Use it however you want. Let me know if you have any questions. Enjoy!

It's web based so you aren't messing around with installing programs and dealing with strict licenses that are limited to a certain number of machines, as well as your files all being saved locally. To manually spin an article, all you do is paste in your article, and let it analyze it for a few seconds, then it takes you to a new screen with your article, and about 75% or so of the words and phrases in it highlighted, meaning it has some suggested synonyms or phrases you can swap them out for. All you do is select the first word/phrase, and the suggested synonym list pops up and you pick which ones you like, then tap the right arrow to move to the next word/phrase, and so forth. By the time you make it through the whole article, your final "spintax" version of it will be so unique it will pass through Copyscape with a breeze *and* still look like it was written by a human, and be perfectly readable. The bottom line is you really need to put the initial time and effort up front to create a master "spintax" version of an article. Once you do that, you can generate hundreds of perfectly readable variations of it in an instant. And this is without even using any of the other bells & whistles in Spin ReWriter, such as shuffling sentences and paragraphs - I don't do any of that (personally I think that just makes a mess of the logical flow of the article). Yes, Spin ReWriter also has the ability to completely automate the whole spinning process too, but I did not like the final output. It's leaps and bounds better than it's competition, with the exception of WordAI, but it's still not "great". You can still tell it was spun. Even WordAI's completely automated output, while the best of the bunch imo, still looks "spun". The reason I ranked Spin ReWriter over WordAI were a few things. It's much cheaper at $77 per year (after promotional discounts) than WordAI, which is over $300 per year. It's manual spinning workflow is much better - more intuitive and better overall functionality. The other thing, was as expensive as WordAI is, the whole UI is really really basic. I'm talking one form field to enter in your article, and maybe a handful of buttons/options. It's too automated, and it's cumbersome to try and clean up it's output within the interface or tweak the spintax to make it output better spun articles.

Then proof read the spun content once and do some corrections which should make it as a human readable one.. After this, your content will become OK quality that passes copyscape test..

It doesn't post any articles for you, it just spins, but it has some of the best editing I have used in a Spin Software. You can throw an article in it, and then go through it and left click on any word, a list of new words popup and you can choose a new word from the list and create a whole new article custom spun yourself. Its not fast to do it that way, but you get the highest quality articles without writing something brand new yourself. It auto-spins pretty good, there are a lot of options. And for the most part are readable. I always find that ANY autospun articles read a bit fishy. The best spinner is not bad either, but I was never really a fan of it. Spin Rewriter is an Online Program and The best Spinner is something you download and have saved on your desktop. I have also used WordAI, and that worked pretty good to.

First thing I found that I did not like was that it was wrapped in Whitehat box. So I unwrapped it by finding it and moving it to its own area. It runs without the wrapper. I then downloaded a 300 - 350 word article and spun it. The article had three quotes. After several hours of work, I ended up with five articles that only had 27% similarity. I ran each of those articles through the plagiarism detector at Small SEO Tools. The best article was 73 percent unique, the worst was 50 percent unique. The problem was the quoted sections. I used the 73 percent article as is because it was going into a blog that added about 300 words to the article and the quote would link back to the article where the quote was made or the Senate bill that was referenced. This article was posted and began ranking on page five for certain keywords and page one for others within three days . This is among some big players like the Direct Marketing Association, The Hill, and several high ranking privacy blogs. This article was placed on a PR 2 blog that is two years old and has a foreign tld. I then took the best two of the remaining articles and ran them through Small SEO Tools's plagiarism detector and worked with them until they were 100 percent unique and posted them on two other blogs I am working on for a client. These blogs are about 6 months old and are not yet ranked. I placed those articles yesterday morning. One of them is ranking for one of the keywords this morning and the other has not yet been indexed in Google. While I have used Spinnerchief for a while, this is my impression of version III. Version three beta needs help. It does not crash so much as it hangs. It especially hangs when there are other .net programs running in the background. Most of the hanging appears to be a poor implementation of multithreading and thread locking. Most often, if you give the program time, it will correct itself, but not always. The cloud thesaurus needs more synonyms. I had to go to Thesaurus.com more than once to find appropriate synonyms. You have to generate far more articles than you need to get relatively unique and human readable articles (if you consider 27 percent similar unique). I had to generate 150 articles and then spend about an hour comparing, editing, and eliminating articles to get the five above. Many of the hangs occurred when I edited one of the articles. This suggests a memory error. Spinnerchief also does not autosave. If the program crashes and you have not saved, you may be hosed out of several hours of work. That is a huge problem. It would be nice if SC checked articles against Google for plagiarism rather than rely on another online tool. I greatly distrust online tools. On the other hand, when used against TBS, I much prefer Spinnerchief because it is easier to use and more intuitive. One thing that needs to be said, even though it was implied, I used SC to spin articles that went on the money site. If used for tiers 2 - 3, I do not believe that it would have required as much work.

Bought it on the advice of a friend who claimed that my spins were "too unreadable" last week. One thing you'll notice right away is that it's all done over your browser. You don't get to download ANYTHING to your desktop. I didn't know that when I bought it, but I guess it's not a big deal. The big thing with this article spinner is it claims to be able to spin material. Here is an example of what it spits out... you'll notice that it is fairly readable but not quite as unique as what you could get by blasting TBS or Spin Chief on loose settings: Original sentence: People like reading reviews that are posted on forums. Code: {People|Individuals} like {reading|checking out|reviewing|browsing|going through} {reviews|evaluations|assessments|write-ups} that are {posted|uploaded|articled} on {forums|online forums}. Nothing too mind blowing. It is quite good at keeping the context of the sentence in place, so it's nice for when I want to post articles that need to be manually approved. It also does multi-level spinning, as you'll see in most the other newer spinning tools around. Overall I can boil it down to the simple fact that it is quite solid at doing quick low-uniqueness spins for highly readable submissions, but seems to lack the ability to dial it up on the uniqueness at the expense of the credibility. Which is to say this tool is very good at what it does, but is not super flexible. So I still use SC for my gibberish spins that need to be really unique. I'm not uber high on it, but for the price it definitely is NOT bad. They also like to pimp other deals and WSO stuff each time you visit the site to use your tool. I'm not REAL big on that, since I feel like I already paid for it so why do I need to be bombarded with ad's... but they aren't bad. They also give you a reference link, mine's http://www.spinrewriter.com/ for instance, not that I'm pimping anything... just an example of the fact that since it's a web app you're going to essentially get the 3rd degree of ad's and promotions. So finally I'm going to rate it a 73%. Definitely not bad... it does one thing VERY well, but because it lacks the ability to gibberish spam highly unique spins as well as it's highly readable less unique spins I can't give it the super high score it would otherwise get. It is probably good for non-English speakers who can't do readable manual spins, but if you want a magic all-in-one this isn't it. It's just good at one job. *EDIT* Now that I think about it 73% is probably a bit harsh... it probably deserves more of an upper 70's score like a 78/100 since it really is quite good at what it does do. I just wish they'd include the low-end basic abilities as well as the fancy footing that it is known for.

Select 'Paragraph Spin'. Though the UI isn't as intuitive as you would like as described as above (ie: selecting paragraphs and apply it to a rule in which there is a variation. This is more useful for creating different version of that paragraph). All of the most complex spinning generally has to be done manually I know your examples is just an example but that's an incorrect one in the fact that there is a chance paragraphs are repeated. As moonlighsunlgh said it's difficult to code software like this because you'll have to create a nested spin more like this: {{2{3{4|}|4{3|}}}|{3{2{4|}|4{2|}}}|{4{2{3|}|3{4|}} }|} What I like to do is to save this paragraph spin as rules (like the on above) and simply use a super replace for the paragraphs which I've already done sentence spinning on. But that's because I'm a manual kind of guy I use this rule often in both sentence spinning and in paragraph spinning to output a nice ratio of unique content.

Is there any spinner that can do Good-Better-Best and remove the original word for TRUE seed articles that will be seen as unique by G i.e. those of 10 000+ How do you guys get around it? ------------ What if for example there is an article of 500 words. It is rewritten 200 times and put into rewrite-level spintax. So effectively the end spun articles would still be around 500 words. Are you telling me that the 'Best' Spinner cannot handle this? Many people (myself included obviously) have many rewrites and thus the spun seed article will have totals exceeding 10 000 even 100 000 depending on how many rewrites are made on the: 1. article level 2. paragraph level 3. sentence level The fourth word level therefore may involve spinning many variations of the same article. The output would be a small 500 article as normal but heavily spun on the article level / paragraph level / sentence level and then finally the word level. Are you telling me that the 'Best' Spinner cannot do this? What on earth justifies annual fees of around $70 if The 'Best' Spinner cannot perform these functions? The Good-Better-Best word level spinning and user modified thesaurus is I admit excellent but spinning on just the word level is useless in 2011 SEO. What are you doing to accommodate 2011 article spinning which involves a lot more than getting auto spins (or even 'quality' manual spins) on the word level only? Can you please forward this query to Jon as I would like to hear what he has to say on this. As you have just told me TBS is restricted to small articles spun on the word level only. Sure you support nested spinning and all that but if the software cannot (or refuses) to handle larger articles which for any SEO benefit at all in 2011 should be spun on multiple levels hence the seed article can exceed 10 000 words or more. This makes The 'Best' Spinner obsolete.

It's too easy in those programs to just click away at all the options and end up with junk at the end. When I submit with AMR I don't really care how readable they are but when I use the spun content to manually created web2.0 sites it takes a lot of extra time if I don't spin my articles well the first time because I want that content to be quality and I proof read all of it.

I can output a 60-70% unique article that passes human readability in about 15 minutes. I'm gonna post a how-to guide on this in a few weeks once I feel I've mastered it.

I'd give you a more detailed explanation if I had one right now but that's basically it. You can try spinrewriter for free and then I think it's something like $24.99 a month. Far cheaper than WordAI and imo it does a better a job.

It is a sequel to Spin Chimp. The former is no longer under development. CR will soon going out of beta and is developed by the same author to replace the former. The only complaint I have for CR is memory usage. It can easily take 1-2GB to load all database in memory although you can start in "preserve / low memory" mode. Oh no scratch that. One other thing. Their development cycle is slow. Time between beta releases could take like a month or more. Wish I can test out new features sooner. I'm just a user. I'm not affiliated with them.

They use a CLOUD AI database that's user fed and constantly updated by people's new inputs. Creates 80+ % unique and if you read the default spintax it sounds like a professional writer re-wrote it. You'll very rarely find a variation in the end article that even looks remotely spun. Puts thebestspinner to shame and seem like a toy. By far best spinner out there and google's fucked if they're going to ever try to overcome it.

But used the pro version in TBS only. Other two are i used trail versions only.. I think TBS is more than enough for quality spun content. Other that spinning I've used TBS for posting in my blogs also by storing my blogs in TBS settings. To say about Spinner chief it has more synonym and phrases than TBS. But it has so many grammatical errors and need to check manually after spinning. In Spin Chimp i didnt use more but its too useful for me but not more than TBS.

I looked into autoblogging and was disgusted by the quality for this site. I'm looking for bids. **General job/content information:** \- I will have an RSS feed aggregated and you can randomly choose 3 articles a day. \- The articles will average 500 words. If we are spinning longer articles you can either choose to skip that article and find something shorter or just cut out paragraphs to make the article smaller. \- We are only spinning each of these three articles only once. \- Spreading the postings throughout the day would be nice. \- Copyscape should be at least 30% different. Rearranging paragraphs and non- keywords is fine... I'll allow you to be as creative as you like. You can also feel free to piss off my readers with opinionated articles here and there ![](http://www.wickedfire.com/images/smilies/smilies/icon7.gif) \- It needs to read decently well to an English reader. I'm not a stickler but it can't be embarrassing. **Payment:** \- I will pay weekly up front via PayPal. \- I reserve the right to cancel the contract after any week if I don't like what I get. **Technical stuff:** \- It will be on a Wordpress blog and submitting it yourself and posting a related image here and there would be a MAJOR plus \- Communication with me should be regular through e-mail. I may sometimes ask to spin a certain article and toss in a certain keyword. \- I don't care if you have a team of different people do it so long as it gets done. \- I own the content and can change it as I see fit (but probably won't). **Start Date:** \- Sunday Nov 8 would be nice. **Reviews:** \- I'd like to see some samples you've already done. **Other:** \- It's sports related if that interests you any more. Please send bids and samples to me via PM and we can begin e-mail dialogue. Thanks!! Berto

I like the way it identifies words and phrases. I say it's way better than TBS. Again we can all hope that this app won't follow TBS that slows down as more people use it. For $25 initial purchase + 3-month subscription I won't hesitate buying it only after 6 months or so.

However after testing the best spinner spinner chief the best free spinner and Word AI I found that spinning tools still have a much needed use. For example if you are a company and have dozens of websites that need contextual links that could easily cost you hundreds if not thousands of dollars every linking campaign. If you use Word AI's turing spinner which rewrites sentences paragraphs and use semantic spinning that makes sense it can save you that expensive cost. I decided to do a review of Word AI which was the best spinning tool compared to the others I tried. In the video I show you how to use the normal spinner and Turing spinner and then check if the spun content passes copyscape for uniqueness. If you have questions about spinning software and how to effectively utilize this tool feel free to comment.

It uses Part of Speech recognition, Grammar Artificial Intelligence and cloud rules created by users. * Unlimited number of spins - your own computer is not going to limit you! Very fast spinning because it's all based on your own local computer. * No need to buy an API subscription, X-Spinner is compatible with all software because it uses the spin protocols of The Best Spinner, Spinrewriter and Wordai - all software has at least one of these. * You can even run X-Spinner on a server and provide a spin service to yourself to other users. * There will be a capable free version, so now everybody can use a spin api without the need to pay for anything. Very easy to operate. Simply enter anything at all for username and password of the spin api (TBS, Spinrewriter or WordAI) in your software; (for example GSA, Kontent Machine, Scrapebox, SEnuke, etc). Select your settings in X-Spinner then hit the green start button. That's it, you're ready to spin! Please note the download is 133mb so you need a good internet connection. Testers must have at least 100 posts, all feedback to be sent to me via PM. Reply to this thread if you are interested.

I have tried a LOT of writers with "great English skills" that are not up to the task of creating quality spun articles. Depends on your needs though. ---------

For lower tier links (like pligg or scrapebox) it probably doesn't matter that much but I wouldn't have your tier 1 links looking like gibberish. ---------POST 3--------- From: cocoholo Date: 1346507640000 Not all 2.0 sites allow gibberish content Wordpress.com is one.

The English language has so many nuances. I mean look for example at the very simple word "set". There are over FIFTY that's 50 definitions for that word alone in the dictionary. If there was a software that could account for this it would be absolutely remarkable. Not to mention an article might be "human readable" but still awkward to the average English speaker. I get this often when I outsource article writing (no offense to my friends overseas your language skills as a whole are much better than mine). Stuff like 1. "Correct SEO methods are completely crucial to achieve maximum success in the search pages." instead of 2. "Proper SEO techniques are very important in order to achieve the best possible ranking in Google." To a foreign reader sentence 1 might sound OK. Yet to a native English speaker it's totally "off" and would hurt credibility if used on a money site. If someone has a software that advanced you've earned my $200+ a year many times over EDIT: According to about.com "set" has 464 definitions... http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blmosdef.htm

I gre tired of having to restart my senuke campaigns because DBC died again and Senuke is failing at registering etc. As decaptcha services sole goal is to reduce the amount of manual labor (having to enter captchas by hand) I found it annoying as hell to constatly check up on it. And the success rate... I can't say I've ever been looking at the pictures directly and seeing wrong captchas, but what I did see is senuke succeeding only after 3rd try to register, while if i decaptcher it never takes more than 2 tries, and usually just 1. If you take this into account, the price gap between 2$ and 1.35$ is getting much smaller, because you actually pay more if the success rate is lower.

I used to see about 80% and now it's only at 50%, and I'm pushing millions of captchas through it, so it isn't just a coincidence.

Though I'm not sure which of the two has a better solve rate off hand. Given that DBC's price is so much lower I can't imagine that DeCaptcher is having a lower cost per thousand solve rate. Even if DBC were to have a 20-30% fail to solve rate I think it would still be more cost effective, and in my personal experience DBC has had above a 90% success rate. @

It can only crack forum specific captchas, any other platforms and you have to use external captcha services, and recaptcha success rate is extremely poor.
com_blackhatworld_www_473d5f1f6e00e2a57a95077a9b6985b10ca798aa_1422580196478,DD15-112,DD15-112.1,3,Xrumer has a lot more bugs than you think. For example, it will report captcha successfully decoded (particularly recaptcha) but in reality, it has not solved it at all and so the registration has failed. The only way to verify this is to go to Debug mode and check one by one. The message you get when you're registering is inaccurate in a great number of cases. There is no way in hell Xrumer will be able to beat a service like Deathbycaptcha, because DBC is specialized to captcha solving OCR (that's all they do) PLUS they have human solvers for those captchas which the OCR did not solve. Xrumer cannot solve captchas for which captcha DLLs haven't been created. Therefore, if you get platform X which has its own captcha format captcha X, and DLL X has not been created by Botmaster, there is no way in hell Xrumer will be able to decode it. Xrumer isn't some amazing intelligent robot which can read like a human and decode any text you put in front of it. External services such as captchabot and DBC, on the other hand, can tackle almost any type of captcha you put in front of it. I'm not sure if captchabot uses human solvers, but if not, that means their OCR is freaking awesome. There is massive, massive room for improvement in captcha solving OCR from baseline of Xrumer. This is, perhaps, where Sweetfunny could really get one up on Botmaster. But, unfortunately, most users would not see it this way, because Xrumer reports so many false successes that you THINK your registration/post has succeeded when in fact it stopped at the captcha (even with 100% correct xmessages).

Someone coded one about 6 weeks ago - lasted about 48 hours Every Recaptcha solve attempt call goes straight to recaptcha headquarters (which is a google product) If they sniff automation - they change the code. If they get bored - they change the code. Basically - they change the code all the time. One day OCR will be that good that it can sort it out, but I've tried every bot solution you can find, and none even get close. (Xrumer, platimum captcha, captcha sniper, magic OCR..none of them work even close)

In fact I think the latest versions of reCaptcha are so hard that they go against modern accessibility requirements - anyone even modestly partially sighted just find them impossible.
com_blackhatworld_www_0ffc4a072c4a84223eca48c2f278f8f69d4885ed_1422595959713,DD15-112,DD15-112.1,2,I read somewhere that it took weeks to break a recaptcha and about 10 minutes for Google to throw together a fix for it. The amount of work it takes to crack can be completely wasted with very little effort. So that only really means that there will likely be no *public* Recaptcha solver. I still get a low rate on xrumer, but it also depends if you use GOOD proxies, but it's better than nothing(at least is one of the few public tools that can break some of them).

Google put out subtle changes to it almost daily. It's like trying to catch an eel while wearing boxing gloves covered with baby oil.

Let'sthink a bit out of the box. Most captchas on like GMail etc. are 1 word, so it might be something like this: ![](http://imagehub.org/f/1tjl/captcha1.jpg) This solves to 'traneaci'. So let's take a look at another Captcha... What about... reCAPTCHA!?!? ![](http://imagehub.org/f/1tjm/recaptcha.jpg) This solves to 'ardway courts'. Wait. Do you see the difference to the GMail captcha? It is two words instead of one. However, our captcha solving services will still solve it for us. So what if we just exploit that and take two GMail captchas and put them into one and take the color off it so it will look like it was always one? ![](http://imagehub.org/f/1tjn/captcha2.jpg) \+ ![](http://imagehub.org/f/1tjp/captcha3.jpg) = ![](http://imagehub.org/f/1tjo/captcha4.jpg) This solves to 'crotstess whotional'. Will the captcha service still solve it? **_Yes_**. Now when you implement that into your program before accessing their API, just use Imagick or gd to glue them together and take off all saturation (i.e. double width, add one captcha on the left, one captcha on the right, change contrast, change colors). Then split the reply at the ' ' and you have two captchas solved for the price of one ![](https://static.blackhatworld.com/blackhat- seo/images/smilies/wink.png) I won't supply you with the exact code for it, because I believe that is a part you should do yourself at this point, because it is the theory that matters, I won't take away your laziness ![](https://static.blackhatworld.com /blackhat-seo/images/smilies/smile.png) Hope you have success with it like I do!

One person that uses one of my bots, said his account got drained from 15 bucks. My software doesn't use an affiliate # so there is no way he made 7000+ posts to CxL over night. All I'm saying is, there is greedy hands in this world so the possibility is good that Decaptcher got it. There is also a possibility that the software vendor upped their affiliate price, which they can do at any time and then lower it at any time. Another thing, the software should notify Decaptcher when the captcha wasn't solved correctly so you get a refund.

Some people like to put out free bots and Decaptcher is a great way for them to make money off of it. If you read the Decaptcher page when you log in, it will tell you that the software vendor can charge what ever they like. Please, take into account, if you use any third-party product (ready-to-use tool or software) the recognition price could be different.

Though I'm not sure which of the two has a better solve rate off hand. Given that DBC's price is so much lower I can't imagine that DeCaptcher is having a lower cost per thousand solve rate. Even if DBC were to have a 20-30% fail to solve rate I think it would still be more cost effective, and in my personal experience DBC has had above a 90% success rate. @

So the builtin ocr and captcha sniper are really limited to certain types of activity. Ex. random blog comments many a times use old captcha types instead of recaptcha. But really, a couple of bucks for 5000 solved captchas at deathbycaptcha... I think it's worth it just fine.

Once you start talking $500+ a month you need to be a MASSIVE spammer to not go with a service rather than a bot. About 45,000 solves at deathbycaptcha for $500. If you are providing a service for others - then put the price up to cover service rather than bot captcha costs.

OCR 2. human-powered recognition services The first option is usually lifetime licensed software that you purchase once and then use it with your solutions. This way, your budget for solving CAPTCHAs is determined once and equals the s\w license price. Problem? Although modern optic recognition patterns are smart enough, the accuracy rate suffers which results in unsuccessful submissions or long time cracking asingle CAPTCHA. The second option, CAPTCHA solving services, powered by humans, need careful attention in regard with the budget as $4-7 per 1000 CAPTCHAs only seems to be small pice, yet when it comes to 100k requests, you can easily end up ruined by the end of the month.

Youcan just Google for this info and see the fact. Nevertheless fake reviews provider will still have a way to overcome this else they will be out of business. In conclusion, there is no fact stating that Amazon is against mass purchasing to boast popularity. However, they do have an active issue with fake reviews.

However unless you're planning to sell Xrumer blasts to other Black Hatters or Webmasters it would be complete overkill. Just purchase a $10 Xrumer blast from any number of folks here on BHW and save yourself all the headache. The only other reason that I can think of for purchasing Xrumer is if you're either working a 24/7 "boiler-room" type of Spam the Internet into submission type of operation or your company is quite sizable and you need Xrumer to drive traffic to new or updated sections of the site or even it's satellite or subsidiary group of websites. I'm sure others may have other examples of when Xrumer is the appropriate software choice but those are the only two I could think of.

Just purchase a $10 Xrumer blast from any number of folks here on BHW and save yourself all the headache. The only other reason that I can think of for purchasing Xrumer is if you're either working a 24/7 "boiler-room" type of Spam the Internet into submission type of operation or your company is quite sizable and you need Xrumer to drive traffic to new or updated sections of the site or even it's satellite or subsidiary group of websites. I'm sure others may have other examples of when Xrumer is the appropriate software choice but those are the only two I could think of.

I would rather get the blast done from a reputable member from BHW instead. What I am wanting is: Using my keywords I want my site blasted to sites that have a PR of 3+. Could the page my site will be linked from have a PR of 3+ ?Want my keywords used as anchor text for my website link.ONLY want my site linking from related niches (web design web development maybe S.E.O and graphic design).Anything else to recommend? I don't want a huge 100k blast maybe something small like between 250 and 1000. I am not an Xrumer expert so if you are an expert in Xrumer and have got positive reviews from people here in BHW I would be interested. PM me if interested... Cheers and thanks in advance!

Yes it is possible for xrumer to blast your site link to PR3 pages but most service providers will not do this. Most xrumer blasters just make profile links without even making anchor text.

What started as an arrest in Ireland pertaining to a case of child pornography took an international twist this past weekend, and brought doubts on the security and privacy of Tor, the popular anonymizing network. It all started with Eric Marques, the CEO of Freedom Hosting, a small hosting company that provides accounts to anyone who wants one. Eric became infamous in the underground of the web because of his willingness to turn a blind eye on any activity that went on inside the network of Freedom Hosting. This included potential child pornography sites, along with other illicit activities.

These make up part of the Deep Web, available only through Tor.

It took me a while to find a good and not too expensive host for it. After a few hosting companies, I found JaguarPC and I never looked back since then. I started with the cheapest VPS ($19.97/month for 10gb diskspace and 150gb bandwidth) and upgraded a few times since then, as my site grew bigger and bigger. I must say I'm very happy with the speeds, much better than some of the dedicated servers I used. Their service is great too! So if you have an adult site with a lot of traffic, try them! PS: They are located in Houston, Atlanta and Las Vegas. They support adult sites, but not on their shared plans.

Twentieth Century Fox said the FBI was investigating who leaked "X-Men Origins: Wolverine " which is set for release in U.S. theaters May 1. The digital file quickly spread across the Internet and was available for free but illegal downloading from hundreds of easily found Web sites. "The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law; the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past " the studio's statement said. Removing the pirated files from the Internet may prove an impossible challenge an industry source said. This source did not want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the matter. Although the studio said it was removed from the Web site that first hosted it the digital file has probably been downloaded tens of thousands of times the source said. "It's not removed from the Internet " the industry source said. "It's still there." Twentieth Century Fox downplayed the value of the pirated copy noting that it was not the final version.

Lawsuits against consumers of pirated content have persuaded many to turn to YouTube-like sites that stream illegal copies rather than allow users to download and save a copy for later use. But is streaming really different from downloading? The question has technical legal and practical aspects and the legal consequences are still unresolved.

If you have reasonably correct-looking documents for ID purposes, these can be supplied as needed to help restore it as well. Nothing is guaranteed, but a well prepared stealth PP should improve the durability of the account (and your use of it for commerce).

If you want to know how to make a stealth paypal hit me though a private message and I will give you my system, even if you are a minor it should be easy for you to do. Matter of fact I'm going to make 10 fully verified stealth paypal accounts today! Also google "aspkin forum" read up over there and you will get many of the answers you need about eGay and PissPal.

Getting a private box and using it to apply for a reloadable debit card with stealth/pseudo info (difficult, but not impossible) can get around the problem, as the bank account associated with the debit card can then be used for the stealth PP. ---------

Also where would I transfer the money into. I was wondering if they have on line bank accounts that I can link to my account. Lastly what personal details would I have to change? Thanks any help is appreciated.

To transfer money, depends on how stealth you want to be, there are many different levels. Less stealth you can send it to another paypal that isnt stealth and has your real bank account. Or you can also buy atm cards from 'Secondeye' or other suppliers to be more stealth.

Or will they come asking for all the other info as well? If anyone has any ideas how I can simply set up a paypal buyer account I would be very grateful!

Could I possibly open a new account with fake name/email and just use a bank account I have never used with paypal before and just use it for buying stuff or would they still want to have more info?

And trust me being suspended does not always come from some bad deal. You can be the victim and still loose your PayPal account. Remember though that after $20,000 you would need another stealth account since that is all the processing you can do with one account in a 4 quarter business year.

Most people here got into using stealth PPs because PP oftenlimits, denies appeals, or closes accounts despite their having REAL, 'i's dotted and t's crossed' info on them. The use of faux accounts permits people to continue using the leading processor even after an unfair or inexplicable limitation happens.

Stuff gets pretty pricey.

For all the trouble its worth and potential legal issues concerning fraud, your better off either not scamming people or finding a legit way to make money.

Sooner or later any and ALL "Stealth" PP accounts will be called to question by PP and you will not be able to verify, so how in the fuck are you going to withdraw large amounts from PP without a bank account or a PP debit card?

By that point, Paypal verifies any number supplied against a national database that ensures the number was actually issued by SSA, is actually assigned to the name, matches the DOB and address info, is from a living person, etc. Meaning, the attempt to restore the account to full service will fail, and the OP will have to wait 180 days to withdraw the funds.

But when it gets to this point, where PP specifies it wants a real SSN/TIN and you can't supply one, it means you can't get your account restored. If you don't JV with someone to use their assigned SSN (or yours), and you don't want to make a LLC, I'm just saying you'll have to accept a frozen account, and wait 6 months to withdraw.

If you created a 'fake' PayPal account, then there's nothing you can do; especially if you've violated PayPal's TOS. It wasn't particulary clever to leave the money in a 'fake' account for that duration though. Realise what you've actually done in their eyes; you've created a fake identity to collect funds - which in many coutries goes against the Anti Money Laudering laws etc.
